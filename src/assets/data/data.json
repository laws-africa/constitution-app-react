Contained in these contracts was a clause that allowed the respondent to cancel the contract at any time, for any reason, as long as a full term\u2019s written notice was given. \r\n\r\n<p>After a series of incidents where the applicants behaved inappropriately in front of young children, the respondent terminated the applicants\u2019 contracts with a written full-term notice. The applicants then approached the High Court for an interim order to allow the children to remain at Pridwin Preparatory School pending the determination of the main application which sought to have the decision of the headmaster to terminate the contract declared invalid and set aside.</p>\r\n", "right_and_principle": "The Constitutional Court had to determine. First, whether independent schools had constitutional duties and obligations that limited their exercise of contractual rights. Secondly, whether the clause in the contract was a constitutionally valid one as it did not afford the other party to the contract a fair hearing before the contract was terminated.", "interpretation": "With respect to the first issue, the Constitutional Court found that the constitutional obligations imposed upon Pridwin do not arise from the contract, but instead, arise directly from the Constitution and the application of section 8(2). The Court held that section 8(2) makes it expressly clear that the rights contained in the Bill of Rights such as the right to basic education, can, depending on the nature of the right, be applied to bind private parties. Thus, section 8(2) imposes constitutional obligations on private entities, such as Pridwin. In subjecting power exercised by private (non-State) parties to constitutional control, section 8(2) recognises the importance of private interactions and their potential to violate human rights and to perpetuate inequality and disadvantage.\n\n<p>The Court then found that independent schools provide \u2018basic education\u2019, in terms of <b>section 29 of the Constitution</b>,  to learners as the nature of the entity providing education is not relevant to determining whether what is offered is \u201cbasic education\u201d. Therefore, section 29(1)(a) is an overarching right to basic education that applies to all persons and is enjoyed by children at public and independent schools alike.</p>\n\n<p>With respect to the second issue, the Court held that a decision to discontinue a learner\u2019s education would be unconstitutional and therefore invalid if the school did not give an opportunity to the learners or their parents/guardian or representatives to make representations before the decision was made by the school to terminate the parent contract and remove the child from the school. The Court held that this is premised on the fact that <b>section 29 of the Constitution</b> places an obligation on all schools, both private and government schools, to not impair or interfere with the right to basic education. In this case, the school was unable to demonstrate appropriate reasons for limiting the rights of the applicants to basic education without providing an opportunity to the applicants to make representations to the school before the decision to remove the children from the school had been taken. The Court therefore held that the <b>section 29</b> right was impaired due to the absence of a fair procedure being followed prior to the termination of the contract. Accordingly, it was declared that that the school had the obligation to consider the rights of the applicants\u2019 children to have their views heard on the matter and to offer this opportunity to them. Therefore, the existence and enforcement of the clause in the contract was found to be unconstitutional and invalid.</p>\n", "citedCases": ["Governing Body of the Juma Musjid Primary School v Essay NO [2011] ZACC 13; 2011 JDR 0343 (CC); 2011 (8) BCLR 761 (CC)", "Barkhuizen v Napier [2007] ZACC 5; 2007 (5) SA 323 (CC); 2007 (7) BCLR 691 (CC)", "Ruta v Minister of Home Affairs [2018] ZACC 52; 2019 (2) SA 329 (CC); 2019 (3) BCLR 383 (CC)", "National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs [1999] ZACC 17; 2000 (2) SA 1 (CC); 2000 (1) BCLR 39 (CC);JT Publishing v Minister of Safety and Security [1996] ZACC 23; 1997 (3) SA 514 (CC); 1996 (12) BCLR 1599 (CC)", "President of the Republic of South Africa v Democratic Alliance [2019] ZACC 35; 2019 JDR 1753 (CC); 2019 (11) BCLR 1403 (CC)", "Sebola v Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd [2012] ZACC 11; 2012 (5) SA 142 (CC); 2012 (8) BCLR 785 (CC); \nIndependent Electoral Commission v Langeberg Municipality [2001] ZACC 23; 2001 (3) SA 925 (CC); 2001 (9) BCLR 883 (CC)", "POPCRU v SACOSWU [2018] ZACC 24; 2019 (1) SA 73 (CC); 2018 (11) BCLR 1411 (CC); \nMankayi v AngloGold Ashanti Ltd [2011] ZACC 3; 2011 (3) SA 237 (CC); 2011 (5) BCLR 453 (CC)", "National Education Health & Allied Workers Union v University of Cape Town [2002] ZACC 27; 2003 (3) SA (1) (CC); 2003 (2) BCLR 154 (CC) at para 25 and S v Boesak [2000] ZACC 25; 2001 (1) SA 912 (CC); 2001 (1) BCLR 36 (CC); \nMEC for Education, Kwazulu-Natal v Pillay [2007] ZACC 21; 2008 (1) SA 474 (CC); 2008 (2) BCLR 99 (CC); \nMinister for Welfare and Population Development v Fitzpatrick [2000] ZACC 6; 2000 (3) SA 422 (CC); 2000 (7) BCLR 713(CC)", "J v National Director of Public Prosecutions [2014] ZACC 1; 2014 (2) SACR 1 (CC); 2014 (7) BCLR 764 (CC); \nS v M [2007] ZACC 18; 2008 (3) SA 232 (CC); 2007 (12) BCLR 1312 (CC); \nDirector of Public Prosecutions, Transvaal v Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development [2009] ZACC 8; 2009 (4) SA 222 (CC); 2009 (7) BCLR 637 (CC); \nC v Department of Health and Social Development, Gauteng [2012] ZACC 1; 2012 (2) SA 208 (CC); 2012 (4) BCLR 329 (CC); \nKwazulu-Natal Joint Liaison Committee v MEC for Education, Kwazulu-Natal [2013] ZACC 10; 2013 (4) SA 262 (CC); 2013 (6) BCLR 615 (CC)", "Head of Department, Mpumalanga Department of Education v Ho\u00ebrskool Ermelo [2009] ZACC 32; 2010 (2) SA 415 (CC); 2010 (3) BCLR 177 (CC); \nAAA Investments (Pty) Ltd v Micro Finance Regulatory Council [2006] ZACC 9; 2007 (1) SA 343 (CC); 2006 (11) BCLR 1255 (CC); \nResidents of Joe Slovo Community, Western Cape v Thubelisha Homes [2009] ZACC 16; 2010 (3) SA 454 (CC); 2009 (9) BCLR 847 (CC); \nAllPay Consolidated Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd v Chief Executive Officer, South African Social Security Agency (No 2) [2014] ZACC 12; 2014 (4) SA 179 (CC); 2014 (6) BCLR 641 (CC); \nDu Plessis v De Klerk [1996] ZACC 10; 1996 (3) SA 850 (CC); 1996 (5) BCLR 658 (CC)", "Centre for Child Law v Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development [2009] ZACC 18; 2009 (6) SA 632 (CC); 2009 (11) BCLR 1105 (CC)", "Teddy Bear Clinic for Abused Children v Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development [2013] ZACC 35; 2014 (2) SA 168 (CC); 2013 (12) BCLR 1429 (CC)", "Ex Parte Gauteng Provincial Legislature: In re Dispute Concerning the Constitutionality of the Gauteng School Education Bill of 1995 [1996] ZACC 4, 1996 (3) SA 165 (CC), 1996 (4) BCLR 537", "Gelyke Kanse v Chairperson of the Senate of the University of Stellenbosch [2019] ZACC 38; 2020 (1) SA 368 (CC); 2019 (12) BCLR 1479 (CC); \n"]}, {"id": "AffordableMedicinesTrustandOthersvMinisterofHealthandAnotherZACCSACCBCLRCC", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2005/3.html", "title": "Affordable Medicines Trust and Others v Minister of Health and Another [2005] ZACC 3; 2006 (3) SA 247 (CC); 2005 (6) BCLR 529 (CC)", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2005-03-11T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_21__Freedom_of_Movement_and_Residence"], "snippet": "The applicants raised various constitutional challenges to section 22C (1)(a) of the Act and the regulations, which included the argument that regulation 18 (which provided that a licence must require a practitioner to practice from a specific approved premise) infringed section 22 of the Constitution and the constitutional right to freedom of movement enshrined in <b>section 21 of the Constitution</b>", "facts_and_issues": "The applicants applied for leave to appeal directly to the Constitutional Court against the order of the Pretoria High Court dismissal of a constitutional challenge to the Medicines and Related Substances Act 101 of 195 (the Act) relating to a new licencing scheme.

For they are some of the decisive factors to which regard must be had even where <b>\u201ca learner already enjoys the benefit of being taught in an official language of choice\u201d</b>.

The applicants applied for the reinstatement of 103 of its members who were retrenched by the respondent. The applicant\u2019s members were retrenched following a retrenchment agreement that was concluded by the respondents and two other unions at the mine, the National Union of Mines (NUM) and United Association of South Africa (UASA). The retrenchments took place after the respondents recognised NUM as the majority union within the company. Both the applicants and UASA became minority unions. The result was that the minority unions would be granted organisational and bargaining rights by the respondent. However, the applicants, unlike UASA, were not recognised for bargaining purposes.

The applicant also raised various other constitutional rights in their application for leave to appeal including infringement of the right to freedom of association in terms of section 18 of the Constitution. \n\n<p>The Court had to determine whether any constitutional rights are limited when an employer consults with a majority union to the exclusion of minority unions.</p>", "interpretation": "The majority judgment penned by Froneman J, focused on the question whether section 23(1) of the Constitution was infringed and only lightly touched on the potential infringement of section 18 of the Constitution, the right to freedom of association. This was because only the section 23 infringement was raised in the applicant\u2019s written submissions. In relation to the question whether section 23(1) of the Constitution was limited, the majority held that the Labour Relations Act gives effect to the right to fair labour practices and the Courts have consistently interpreted section 189 of the Labour Relation Act to exclude any need for individual and parallel consultation where a collective agreement exists. The right to individual consultation during the retrenchment process in these circumstances was found not to be supported by the Constitution nor the Labour Relations Act. The majority also held that the freedom of association challenge by the applicant failed as this would require the Court to adopt a proposition that the right to freely associate meant that every union must be treated equally, and enjoy all statutory entitlements, regardless of its size. It held further that an employee had the right to join a trade union of their preference, however this did not include the right that their preferred union be empowered in every way they desired.\n\n<p>The dissenting judgment by Jafta J, however disagreed with the majority judgment that the right to freedom of association challenge was not properly pleaded and held that in the context of labour relations this right enables workers to join unions of their own choice. This right is fortified by the right to form or join a trade union of one\u2019s choice guaranteed by <b>section 23(2)(a) of the Constitution</b>.

The majority judgment states that there are different but warranted justifications for ongoing protection afforded to child victims, witnesses and accused. The Court acknowledged the open justice principle and the importance of freedom of expression, however held that the default position of offering the child participants ongoing protection did not result in a severe disadvantage on media freedom. The Court declared <b>section 154(3)</b> invalid and ordered an interim reading-in which specified that a person who is protected under the section does not forfeit the protections upon reaching adulthood, and is entitled to provide or withhold consent to the publication of their identity after reaching adulthood \u2013 or if consent is withheld, a competent court may be approached by the media to request the lifting of the publication ban.</p>\n\n<p>Cameron J, Froneman J and Jafta J agreed with the majority decision on the issue of victim protection but differed on question of ongoing protection.

The minority judgments held that the right to freedom of expression and the principle of open justice tipped the scales in favour of a default regime in which anonymity protection ended when a protected child reaches 18 years of age, unless a court expressly extends the protection. The dissenting judgments argued further that the conclusion that the rights to dignity, privacy and the best interests of the child were infringed was hard to understand in the context of the ongoing protection.

The applicants were each born outside of South Africa to a South African parent prior to 1 January 2013 (being the date on which the <b> 2010 Amendment</b> came into effect).</p>", "right_and_principle": "Based on the Respondents\u2019 interpretation of the 2010 Amendment, the applicants were unable to gain citizenship, despite having the right to gain citizenship under the previous version of the Citizenship Act had they registered their births.\n\n<p><b>Section 20 of the Constitution provides that: \u2018No citizen may be deprived of citizenship'.</b></p> \n\n<p>The issue before the Constitutional Court was whether it was possible to interpret section 2(1) of the 2010 Amendment in a manner constitutionally complaint with section 20 of the Constitution. Interrelated to this question was whether the phrase \u2018any person who is born\u2019 in section 2(1)(b) meant that the section applied only to future persons born to South African citizens, or whether it could be interpreted to include past births too. </p> If the section only applied to future cases, it would have deprived people entitled to citizenship by descent under the previous version of the Citizenship Act merely because they were born before 1 January 2013. </p>\n", "interpretation": "Section 2(1) of the 2010 Amendment</b> classifies a citizen as any person who: <p>(a) who immediately prior to the commencement of the 2010 Amendment was a South African citizen  by birth  (i.e. immediately  prior to 1 January 2013); or</p> <p>(b) who is born in or outside of South Africa to a South African citizen.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitutional Court interpreted <b>section 2(1)(a) and (b) of the amended Citizenship Act</b> in a way that it did not arbitrarily deprive persons of their citizenship overnight. The Constitutional Court held that it was clear that section 2(1)(a) retains citizenship only for those who were considered \u201ccitizens by birth\u201d before the commencement of the 2010 Amendment. This could create an anomaly as persons who acquired citizenship by descent under the previous version of the Citizenship Act would now be excluded. This apparent exclusion could be resolved by adopting a purposive interpretation of section 2(1)(b). \n\n<p>The Court interpreted the term \u2018is born\u2019 in section 2(1)(b) as a \u201cstate of being\u201d not indicative of a tense, but rather including all persons regardless of when they were born. The Court held that this was a reasonable and constitutionally compliant interpretation which meant that section 2 was applicable to persons born to a South African parent before and after 1 January 2013, curing the anomaly. </p> This interpretation allowed for all categories of citizens who acquired citizenship by birth or descent in terms of the previous version of the Citizenship Act to be included. As the 2010 Amendment could be interpreted in a constitutionally compliant manner, the findings of invalidity in the High Court were not confirmed by the Constitutional Court.</p> \n\n<p>The Constitutional Court thereby ensured that the sections of the 2010 Amendment would be interpreted and applied consistently with <b>section 20 of the Constitution</b>.</p> \n\n<p>(i) On section 20 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court held that although the importance of citizenship should not be overemphasised, citizenship is a gateway right to many other constitutional rights \u2013 namely, freedom of movement, freedom of trade and political rights, and is more than a legal status. Citizenship related to the core of a person\u2019s identity, a sense of belonging in a community and to security of a person most especially in communities rife with xenophobia. Deprivation of, or interference with, a person\u2019s citizenship status affects their private and family life, their choices concerning where establish their homes, apply for jobs, enrol in schools; whether they can form part of the community; their ability to participate fully in the political activity and governance; and the extent to which they may exercise freedom of movement.</p>\n\n<p>(ii) The Constitutional Court held that whilst certain rights in the Constitution are only available to South African citizens, drawing arbitrary and irrational distinctions between citizens and non-citizens through legislation or decision-making is inconsistent with the Constitution. </p>\n\n<p>(iii) Legislation must be interpreted to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, but any interpretation must remain consistent with the text of the legislation. The Constitutional Court interpreted <b>section 2(1) of the 2010 Amendment</b> by analysing the plain meaning of the words, the context of the case and section\u2019s purpose in light of the Bill of Rights. The Constitutional Court adopted an interpretation that was consistent with and promoted both the text of the section (by recognising that the section\u2019s language is not time-specific but rather linked to a condition of having been born) as well as the Bill of Rights (not to arbitrarily deprive persons of their citizenship overnight, as required by section 20 linked to other constitutional rights).</p>\n", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "CityofJohannesburgMetropolitanMunicipalityvBlueMoonlightPropertiesPtyLtdandAnotherCCZACCBCLRCCSACC", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2011/33.html ", "title": "City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality v Blue Moonlight Properties 39 (Pty) Ltd and Another (CC) [2011] ZACC 33; 2012 (2) BCLR 150 (CC); 2012 (2) SA 104 (CC)\n", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_26__Housing"], "snippet": "The Court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation.

The owner of the property (Blue Moonlight) approached the South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg seeking an order to evict the occupiers in order to develop the property. The occupiers opposed the eviction on the basis that it would almost certainly render them homeless and argued that the City of Johannesburg (the City)  had an obligation to provide them with temporary housing under the Constitution and the <b>Prevention of Illegal Eviction and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act, 19 of 1998 (PIE)</b> before they could be evicted.  \r\n\r\n<p>The High Court granted the eviction order, but also ordered the City to remedy its housing policy as it was found to be unconstitutional and the High Court issued a structural interdict against the City obliging the City to report back to the High Court on the steps taken remedying its housing policy. The City was also ordered to provide temporary housing to the occupiers and to pay Blue Moonlight compensation until the eviction date. The City subsequently appealed the High Court\u2019s order to  the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). The SCA only set aside the structural interdict against the City and the High Court\u2019s compensation order and declared the City\u2019s housing policy unconstitutional to the extent that it excluded the occupiers from temporary housing and the City was ordered to provide them with \u201ctemporary emergency accommodation\u201d. The City appealed the SCA\u2019s order to the Constitutional Court.</p>", "right_and_principle": "The Court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation. The City argued that it was neither obliged nor able to provide emergency accommodation in these circumstances and that its role in this regard was secondary. The City argued that local government does not have a primary role in fulfilling the right to access to adequate housing and that this mandate falls on the shoulders of the national and provincial government. The City argued that it fulfilled its duties after requesting assistance from provincial government and no more could be expected from it. The occupiers opposed the City\u2019s appeal and also applied for a conditional cross-appeal requesting that an order of eviction be linked to the condition that suitable alternative accommodation be provided and that the City report back on steps taken to remedying its housing policy.", "interpretation": "In a unanimous judgment by Van der Westhuizen J, the Court held that an owner's constitutional right not to be deprived of property must be interpreted in the social and historical context and be balanced against the right of access to adequate housing and not to be evicted arbitrarily from one's home. The Court emphasised that apartheid legislation undermined both the right of access to adequate housing and the right to property. Section 25 prohibits arbitrary deprivation of property, but also undertakes to redress unequal social conditions.</p>  Section 26 of the Constitution \u201chighlights the transformative vision of the Constitution\u201d and PIE was enacted to specifically prevent the historical abuse of displacement of people. In this case, even though housing unlawful occupiers indefinitely suspends an owner's right to use and enjoy property, evictions can only be carried out in terms of PIE. PIE allows for the eviction of unlawful occupiers only in circumstances where such eviction is just and equitable.\r\n\r\n<p>In deciding whether an eviction is just and equitable in terms of PIE, the Court considered that many of the occupiers had lived on the property for a very long time, the occupation had once been lawful, Blue Moonlight was aware of the occupiers\u2019 presence when it purchased the property, and the eviction of the occupiers would render them homeless while there was no competing risk of homelessness on the part of Blue Moonlight. Furthermore, the Court held that a key consideration was whether the City had made reasonable efforts to provide alternative accommodation to the occupiers. After considering the City\u2019s housing policy, the Court noted that the policy differentiated between persons relocated by the City itself and those evicted by private landowners. However, where relocation was sought by the City, these persons were housed in temporary accommodation, which was not the case with persons evicted by private landowners.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Court emphasised that section 26(2) of the Constitution recognises that the state is constrained by resources in giving effect to the right to adequate housing and therefore a housing policy may differentiate and give preference to categories of people; however any differentiation must be rational. The City\u2019s housing policy was found to be \u201crigid\u201d. The Court held that the policy failed to take into account whether emergency accommodation should be made available in individual cases, considering the categories of persons affected (such as elderly people and children) and their circumstances, and that an imminent eviction might render them homeless, regardless of whether the eviction or relocation is sought by the City or a private landowner. The Court held that this differentiation was not rational. Where an eviction may result in homelessness, it is irrelevant whether such eviction is at the instance of the City or a private landowner. The Court emphasised that this matter concerns \u201ctemporary\u201d accommodation in an emergency as defined in Chapter 12 of the National Housing Code and not \u201cpermanent\u201d housing. The obligation, while derived from the right to progressive realisation of adequate housing in terms of <b>section 26(2) of the Constitution</b>, is distinct from the obligation to address permanent housing needs.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Court therefore declared the City\u2019s housing policy unconstitutional and in violation of section 26 of the Constitution to the extent that it excluded people evicted by private landowners from its temporary housing programme. The Court dismissed the City\u2019s appeal and held that the occupiers had to vacate the properties by a given date. The Court stipulated that the City was to provide the evictees with \"temporary accommodation in a location as near as feasibly possible to the area\" in which the building was situated, in order to ensure that the occupiers were not rendered homeless between the date of eviction and the date by which the City would have to provide emergency housing.</p>", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "ConstitutionalityoftheMpumalangaPetitionsBillZACCSACCBCLR", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2001/10.html ", "title": "Constitutionality of the Mpumalanga Petitions Bill, 2000 [2001] ZACC 10; 2002 (1) SA 447 (CC); 2001 (11) BCLR 1126", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2001-10-05T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["Provincial_executive_authority"], "snippet": "The first issue that the Premier raised was whether the legislature was permitted by <b>the Constitution</b> to pass the Petitions Bill.

The decisive question is whether private persons should be bound by the right in the Bill of Rights. In relation to security of tenure, the duty (both positive and negative) imposed by the right to security of tenure does in fact rest on private persons. People in need of protection under ESTA often reside on land owned by private persons, as in this case. The obligation resting on an owner is a positive one. A private party is required by <b>section 25(6) of the Constitution</b> through ESTA to accommodate another on their land.

The Public Protector in her remedial action (i.e. binding action to be carried out in terms of the Public Protector\u2019s findings) then directed that the President take note of her findings of maladministration, improper conduct, and corruption against the respondent and take disciplinary action.

The High Court (Gauteng Division, Pretoria) held that the purpose of an interim interdict was to protect the rights of an aggrieved party pending finalisation of the review application and that the first respondent met the requirements for an interim interdict. The High Court emphasised that the harm to the first respondent would be irreparable, which involved being disciplined by the President and criminally investigated.

The test had sufficient safeguards in place to protect these powers and functions when an interim order was being sought. In relation to the Public Protector\u2019s argument, the Court held that the High Court did take into account the effect that the interim interdict would have on her office and that the Public Protector was not rendered ineffective by the interim interdict as the investigation had been completed.\r\n\r", "citedCases": ["National Treasury v Opposition to Urban Tolling Alliance [2012] ZACC 18; 2012 (6) SA 223 (CC); 2012 (11) BCLR 1148 (CC)", "Biowatch Trust v Registrar, Genetic Resources [2009] ZACC 14; 2009 (6) SA 232 (CC); 2009 (10) BCLR 1014 (CC)", "Tiekiedraai Eiendomme (Pty) Limited v Shell South Africa Marketing (Pty) Limited [2019] ZACC 14; 2019 JDR 0719 (CC); 2019 (7) BCLR 850 (CC) ", "Economic Freedom Fighters v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others; Democratic Alliance v Speaker of the National Assembly [2016] ZACC 11; 2016 (5) BCLR 618 (CC); 2016 (3) SA 580 (CC)", "Gcaba v Minister for Safety and Security [2009] ZACC 26; 2010 (1) SA 238 (CC); 2010 (1) BCLR 35 (CC)", "Chirwa v Transnet Limited [2007] ZACC 23; 2008 (4) SA 367 (CC); 2008 (3) BCLR 251 (CC) ", "General Council of the Bar of South Africa v Jiba [2019] ZACC 23; 2019 JDR 1194 (CC); 2019 (8) BCLR 919 (CC) ", "Mankayi v AngloGold Ashanti Ltd [2011] ZACC 3; 2011 (3) SA 237 (CC); 2011 (5) BCLR 453 (CC)", "Minister of Safety and Security v Luiters [2006] ZACC 21; 2007 (2) SA 106 (CC); 2007 (3) BCLR 287 (CC)", "Phoebus Apollo Aviation CC v Minister of Safety and Security [2002] ZACC 26; 2003 (2) SA 34 (CC); 2003 (1) BCLR 14 (CC) at para 9; and S v Boesak [2000] ZACC 25; 2001 (1) SA 912 (CC); 2001 (1) BCLR 36 (CC)", "Loureiro v Imvula Quality Protection (Pty) Ltd [2014] ZACC 4; 2014 (3) SA 394 (CC); 2014 (5) BCLR 511 (CC) ", "Magajane v Chairperson, North West Gambling Board [2006] ZACC 8; 2006 (5) SA 250 (CC); 2006 (10) BCLR 1133 (CC)", " Phillips v National Director of Public Prosecutions [2005] ZACC 15; 2006 (1) SA 505 (CC); 2006 (2) BCLR 274 (CC)", "S v Pennington [1997] ZACC 10; 1997 (4) SA 1076; 1997 (10) BCLR 1413", "Radio Pretoria v Chairperson, Independent Communications Authority of South Africa [2004] ZACC 24; 2005 (4) SA 319 (CC); 2005 (3) BCLR 231 (CC)", "African Christian Democratic Party v Electoral Commission [2006] ZACC 1; 2006 (3) SA 305 (CC); 2006 (5) BCLR 579 (CC)", "South Cape Corporation (Pty) Ltd v Engineering Management Services (Pty) Ltd 1977(3) SA 534 (A) (South Cape Corporation)", "lnternational Trade Administration Commission v SCAW South Africa (Pty) Ltd [2010] ZACC 6; 2012 (4) SA 618 (CC); 2010 (5) BCLR 457 (CC).", "Machele v Mailula [2009] ZACC 7; 2010 (2) SA 257 (CC); 2009 (8) BCLR 767 (CC)", "United Democratic Movement v Speaker of the National Assembly [2017] ZACC 21; 2017 (5) SA 300 (CC); 2017 (8) BCLR 1061 (CC).", "Public Protector v South African Reserve Bank [2019] ZACC 29; 2019 (6) SA 253 (CC); 2019 (9) BCLR 1113 (CC)", "Florence v Government of the Republic of South Africa [2014] ZACC 22; 2014 (6) SA 456 (CC); 2014 (10) BCLR 1137 (CC)", "Trencon Construction (Pty) Limited v Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa Limited [2015] ZACC 22; 2015 (5) SA 245 (CC); 2015 (10) BCLR 1199 (CC) ", "National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs [1999]  ZACC 17[1999] ZACC 17; ; 2000 (2) SA 1 (CC); 2000 (1) BCLR 39 (CC)", "Black Sash Trust v Minister of Social Development (Freedom Under Law intervening) [2017] ZACC 20; 2017 (9) BCLR 1089 (CC) (Black Sash)", "Swartbooi v Brink [2003] ZACC 25; 2006 (1) SA 203 (CC); 2003 (5) BCLR 502 (CC)", "South African Social Security Agency v Minister of Social Development (Corruption Watch (NPC) RF Amicus Curiae) [2018] ZACC 26; 2018 JDR 1451 (CC); 2018 (10) BCLR 1291 (CC)", "President of the Republic of South Africa v South African Rugby Football Union [1999] ZACC 11; 2000 (1) SA 1(CC)[1999] ZACC 11; ; 1999 (10) BCLR 1059 (CC)", "Head of Department: Mpumalanga Department of Education v Ho\u00ebrskool Ermelo [2009] ZACC 32; 2010 (2) SA 415 (CC); 2010 (3) BCLR 177 (CC)\r\n"]}, {"id": "EconomicFreedomFightersvSpeakeroftheNationalAssemblyandOthersDemocraticAlliancevSpeakeroftheNationalAssemblyandOthersZACCBCLRCCSACC", "href": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2016/11.html", "title": "Economic Freedom Fighters v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others; Democratic Alliance v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others [2016] ZACC 11; 2016 (5) BCLR 618 (CC); 2016 (3) SA 580 (CC)", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2016-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["Chapter_9_Institutions"], "snippet": "The case concerned the legal status of the remedial powers that are vested in the Public Protector after the second respondent failed to comply with the remedial action taken against him.

This is because Part A of Schedule 5 of the Constitution lists the functional areas of exclusive provincial legislative competence and the fifth item is \u2018liquor licences\u2019. The President believed that the inclusion of this item meant that Parliament may, in terms of section 44(2) of the Constitution only intervene by passing legislation with regard to a matter falling within a functional area listed in Schedule 5, when it is necessary in certain prescribed circumstances.

The Minister argued further that even if the Bill infringed on the provinces\u2019 exclusive powers it was justified in terms of <b>section 44(2) of the Constitution</b>.

The Court held that liquor licenses is a narrower construct than liquor trade and that national government has the competence to regulate the liquor trade in all respects other than liquor licensing.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Court explained that Schedule 4 competencies should be interpreted as being distinct from and excluding Schedule 5 competencies, but acknowledged that the separation of functional areas in Schedule 4 can never be absolute. Cameron J explained that where it is evident that the matter requires regulation inter-provincially (between provinces) as opposed to intra-provincially (within a single province), then the matter will fall within Schedule 4. Where provinces are given exclusive powers in Schedule 5, these apply to matters which can be regulated intra-provincially. Cameron J formulated the \u201cpith and substance\u201d test for determining legislative competence, which looks at whether the substance of the Bill falls within Schedule 4 or 5. That is, whether the substance requires inter or intra-provincial cooperation. The substance of the Bill depends on the purpose and effect of the Bill. All provisions which do not fall within the main substance of the Bill are treated as incidental and are disregarded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court was required to individually look at the three main areas of the Bill and determine whether the Bill fell within Schedule 4 or 5 for each area. It was held that the substance of the Bill was directed at three objectives. Firstly, the prohibition of cross-holdings between producers, distributors and retailers, and this was held to be an exclusive national competence. Secondly, the establishment of uniform conditions for national registration of manufacturers and distributors. Here it was held that provincial exclusive competence in relation to liquor licenses was not intended to cover the manufacturing and distribution of liquor because this was not an intra-provincial activity and was therefore an exclusive national competence. The third objective was to prescribe detailed mechanisms to provincial legislators for establishing retail licensing mechanisms. This was found to be an exclusive provincial competence under Schedule 5, which was liquor licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cameron J interpreted \u201cliquor licenses\u201d in Part A of Schedule 5 as referring to intra-provincial liquor licenses, but he found that even if exclusive provincial competence in respect of liquor licenses did extend to the manufacturing and distribution, national government\u2019s interest in maintaining economic unity would enable national government to intervene in terms of Section 44(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court concluded that the Liquor Bill was unconstitutional. In terms of Section 44(2), the national government was justified in intervening and creating a national system of registration for manufacturers and distributors and in prohibiting cross-holdings.

The Court found that the national government\u2019s powers with respect to local government are only those that Chapter 7 on the Constitution allocates to it. \n\n<p>The Constitution empowers the national government to establish criteria for determining when an area is a metropolitan area. These criteria are prescribed by the Structures Act. Sections 4 and 5 of the Act allow the national Minister for Provincial and Local Government to apply the criteria in order to declare areas as metropolitan areas and to determine their boundaries. The provinces argued that the declaration of metropolitan areas is a provincial power which is incidental to the power to establish municipalities. The Court held that application of the criteria formed part of the function of boundary determination which the Constitution vests in the Demarcation Board, and not the national or provincial levels of government.

The Court rejected this argument by holding that a district management area is part of a district municipality and not a separate municipality. The Court found that the establishment of district management areas impacts on the boundaries of municipalities and is accordingly a function to be performed by the Demarcation Board.

The Court held that validity of legislation that gives the executive wide powers must be considered against the Constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers. By considering various foreign law approaches, the Court noted that Commonwealth countries had a clear separation of power when it came to the judiciary but that the separation between the legislature and executive is not as well defined. The Court also noted that in the instance where parliament is established in terms of a written Constitution, the nature of its power to delegate legislative power depends on the language of the Constitution with due regard to the country\u2019s specific history. \r\n\r\n<p>The majority judgment held that although the delegation of subordinate legislative power is necessary for a government to function, the delegation of power to the executive to amend or repeal legislation is not the same. Sections 59 to 61 of the Constitution prescribe how Parliament must make and change laws and provide strict participation conditions by both houses of Parliament. The Court held that deviation from these constitutional requirements could potentially only be justified in exceptional circumstances such as war or under a state of emergency. The unlimited general power to amend the Transition Act, afforded to the President by section 16A was held not be justifiable on the grounds of necessity. Therefore, the majority found that section 16A of the Transition Act was inconsistent with the Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority then considered whether the proclamations could nevertheless be justified within the President\u2019s powers in terms of section 235 of the Constitution, but ultimately found they could not. As section 16A of the Transition Act was found to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the proclamations endorsed in terms of this section were declared unconstitutional and invalid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dissenting judgment by Madala J and Ngoepe AJ disagreed with the majority judgment that section 235(8) of the Constitution, could not have been a source of power for the President to issue the proclamations. The dissenting judgment held that when interpreting section 235(8) of the Constitution one must take into account that it dealt with unique transitional arrangements to  ensure transfer to a new constitutional order and that the President was given wide powers for this transitional phase. On this interpretation, the dissent reasoned that the Court would not be able to strike down the proclamations on the basis that there could not have been a valid assignment of the administration of the relevant sections of the Transition Act in terms of section 235(8) of the Constitution.\r\n", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "FedsureLifeAssuranceLtdandOthersvGreaterJohannesburgTransitionalMetropolitanCouncilandOthersZACCSABCLR", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1998/17.html ", "title": "Fedsure Life Assurance Ltd and Others v Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council and Others [1998] ZACC 17; 1999 (1) SA 374; 1998 (12) BCLR 1458\n", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "1998-10-14T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_33__Just_Administrative_Action"], "snippet": "The issue in this case was whether resolutions of the municipal councils constitute administrative action.", "facts_and_issues": "[Note: This case was decided under the <b>Interim Constitution</b>, but the decision remains relevant and applicable.]\r\n\r\n<p>[The Eastern Metropolitan Substructure, Western Metropolitan Substructure, Southern Metropolitan Substructure and the Northern Metropolitan Substructure were all transitional substructures of the Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council as at June 1996.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The metropolitan structures passed resolutions to substantially increase general rates on property and property rights within the Eastern and Northern Metropolitan Substructure areas, thereby generating surpluses in income from those areas to offset deficits in the budgets of the Western and Southern  Metropolitan Substructures and Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council through subsidisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was that ratepayers in some areas were required to pay increased property rates and others enjoyed a decrease in their rates.

The Court then considered the alternative main argument that section 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 infringed sections 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution. The Court held that the analysis contains two stages. One first has to determine whether there was an infringement of sections 11 and 13 of the Constitution. If there was an infringement then one has to analyse whether this infringement may be justified under <b>s 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> (the limitation clause \u2013 now <b>section 36 of the Constitution</b>). On this analysis, the Court held that section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act unduly infringed on section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution and declared it invalid only to the extent that answers given at such an inquiry may be used against such a person in criminal proceedings against the person.\n\n<p>It is important to note that this matter was heard in terms of the Interim Constitution. <b>Section 36 of the Constitution</b> (the limitation of rights provision) is the replacement to section 33 of the Interim Constitution.

The Court emphasised that a broad interpretation should be given to the right at this stage as the second stage of the limitation test involving <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> prescribes the criteria that has to be met before an entrenched right can be justifiably limited. The Court held that section 417(2)(b) limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and then turned to the second stage of the limitation test. The second stage involved analysing whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable in a democratic society taking into account the prescribed factors in <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>.

The Court indicated that one of the types of property included under <b>section 25</b>, in addition to land <b></b>), are physical, moveable things e.g., motor vehicles.

The Court held that the deprivation is arbitrary \u201cwhen the \u2018law\u2019 referred to in section 25(1) does not provide sufficient reason for the particular deprivation in question or is procedurally unfair\u201d. The Court also gave a list of factors to be taken into account to determine whether there is \u2018sufficient reason\u2019, such as the nature and complexity of the relationship between the means and ends; and the nature or type of the right or property in question (i.e. ownership in land or other extensive property rights will require more justification in order to be sufficient).</p>\n\n<p>Following this analysis, the Court held that section 114 of the Act deprived FNB permanently of all its rights and benefits as owner of the vehicles. On applying the test for whether the deprivation was arbitrary or not, and therefore whether the deprivation was constitutional or not, the Court concluded that the deprivation, the seizure by SARS under section 114 of FNB\u2019s vehicles, was arbitrary and unconstitutional because there was insufficient reason justifying it. The Court held that: (i) there was no connection between the debt of the debtors and the owner of the property (FNB); (ii) there was no connection between the debt and the property (FNB\u2019s vehicles); (iii) the property owner (FNB) did not detriment SARS by placing the property (the vehicles) in the possession of the debtor hence there is no reason why the property owner should be subjected to interference or sanction.</p> \n\n<p>The Court therefore found section 114 of the Act unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed SARS to detain and sell seized property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.</p>", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "FosevMinisterofSafetyandSecurityZACCBCLRSA", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1997/6.html ", "title": "Fose v Minister of Safety and Security [1997] ZACC 6; 1997 (7) BCLR 851; 1997 (3) SA 786", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "1997-06-05T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_38__Enforcement_of_Rights"], "snippet": "The Constitutional Court considered whether to award damages/money to the applicant if there was a finding of wrongdoing by the government and violation of constitutional rights.

These provisions led to the disbanding of the Directorate of Special Operations, a specialised crime fighting unit located under the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and its replacement with the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), which is located within the South African Police Service (SAPS).The challenged laws were passed by Parliament and were assented to and signed by the President.

The applicant also alleged that the process of enactment failed to comply with various constitutional obligations relating to public participation, accountability, upholding international obligations, and allowing the NPA to properly exercise its functions. The High Court dismissed the constitutional challenges and held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the constitutional challenges as only the Constitutional Court had the authority to determine whether Parliament or the President had failed to fulfil their constitutional obligations.

However, the majority disagreed with the minority view that the Constitution does not oblige the State to establish and maintain an independent corruption fighting body. The majority held that while the Constitution did not expressly demand that a corruption-fighting unit should be established, its scheme taken as a whole and international law agreements which are binding on the state imposed a pressing duty on the state to set up an effective and independent mechanism to prevent and root out corruption. The second issue considered was whether the legislation that gave effect to the DPCI met the requirements of independence and was therefore constitutionally compliant. \r\n\r\n<p>In considering the legislative provisions governing the DPCI, the majority held that it did not meet the constitutional requirement of appropriate independence. The reason for the majority\u2019s conclusion was that the DPCI was insufficiently protected from political influence in its structure and functioning.

The Court held that the State had to create the conditions for access to adequate housing for people at all economic levels of society. The extent of the State's obligation was defined by three key elements, which had to be considered separately: the obligation to take reasonable legislative and other measures; to achieve the progressive realisation of section 26; and within available resources. For a person to have access to adequate housing, the Court held that there had to be the provision of land, services (such as the provision of water, the removal of sewage and the financing of all these) and a dwelling.\r\n\r\n<p>The Court further held that <b>section 26</b> placed an obligation on the State and all other entities and persons to desist from preventing or impairing the right of access to adequate housing.

A reasonable housing program, capable of facilitating the realisation of the right, had clearly required the State to allocate responsibilities and tasks to the different spheres of government and ensure that the appropriate financial and human resources were available to implement it. The formation of a program, however, was only the first stage in meeting the State's obligations. The program also had to be reasonably implemented, as failure to do so would not constitute compliance with the State's obligations.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court found that \u201creasonableness\u201d requires that a program implemented in order to realise a socio-economic right must be \u201ccomprehensive\u201d, \u201ccoherent\u201d, \u201cbalanced\u201d and \u201cflexible\u201d. More importantly, the Court insisted that a \u201cprogram that excludes a significant sector of society cannot be said to be reasonable\u201d. On this basis, The Court found the state housing program to be invalid to the extent that it failed to make provision for people in immediate and desperate need. The program, although laudable, concentrated unduly on the goal of constructing permanent houses for as many people as possible over time, instead of providing some form of shelter for the desperate in the interim. Therefore, the Court issued a declaratory order which required the State to design and implement a programme that included measures to provide relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the Constitutional Court declared that the government had not met its constitutional obligations and ordered the government, within its available resources, to devise, fund, implement and supervise measures to provide relief for all who are in desperate need.</p>\r\n", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "GreysMarineHoutBayPtyLtdandOthersvMinisterofPublicWorksandOthersZASCAAllSASCASASCA", "href": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZASCA/2005/43.html", "title": "Greys Marine Hout Bay (Pty) Ltd and Others v Minister of Public Works and Others [2005] ZASCA 43; [2005] 3 All SA 33 (SCA); 2005 (6) SA 313 (SCA)\n", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2005-05-13T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_33__Just_Administrative_Action"], "snippet": "The questions in <b>Greys Marine</b> were whether the Minister\u2019s conduct to grant a lease to Bluefin was administrative action or not; and if so, whether the tenants\u2019 and visitors\u2019 right to just administrative action had been violated in the granting of the lease.\n", "facts_and_issues": "The Minister of Public Works decided to grant a lease of a portion of the Hout Bay quayside to a company, Bluefin (Pty) Ltd, established by a group of women who were entering the fishing industry (from which they were historically excluded).

One of the founding values of our constitutional democracy is \u201ca multi-party system of democratic government, to ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness.\u201d This founding value must be given expression at the level of national, provincial and local government. Thus one of the objects of local government is \u201cto provide democratic and accountable government for local communities\u201d.

A deliberate decision was therefore made to confer the power to establish municipal areas upon an independent authority. In coming to this conclusion, the Court considered its judgment in Executive Council, Western Cape v Minister of Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development where it found that constitutional \u201cauthority to determine municipal boundaries vests solely in the Demarcation Board.\u201d That authority extends to all categories of municipality.\r\n\r\n<p>The Court found that the Municipal Demarcation Board was an independent authority vested with the power to draw municipal boundaries. In giving this board the power, the Constitution sought to prevent political interference in the process of creating municipal boundaries. However, this power was limited by the authority of Parliament to draw provincial boundaries. For the Court, it was inevitable that the alteration of provincial boundaries would impact on municipal boundaries. This was implicit in the power to alter provincial boundaries. Therefore, the Court found that the Twelfth Amendment did not violate <b>the Constitution</b> in interfering with municipal boundaries in the course of redrawing provincial boundaries.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>With respect to the second issue, the Court raised doubt regarding whether the national legislative process for constitutional amendments was properly followed.

On this basis, the Court rejected the suggestion that the learner could attend another school as the Constitution requires for difference to be reasonably accommodated and celebrated. The Court ruled that the constitutional rights and protections namely, under <b>sections 15 and 31</b> applied equally to both compulsory and voluntary (non-compulsory) practices of culture and religion.\n\n<p>The Court noted that the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of religion or culture under <b>section 9 of the Constitution</b> is different from the protection of religion in <b>section 15</b> and culture in <b>sections 30 and 31</b> under the separate constitutional rights, even if there is overlap.</p>\n\n<p>The Court observed that: (i) religion generally relates to personal faith and belief; (ii) culture relates to traditions and beliefs developed by a community; (iii) there is an overlap between the two as religious practices are often influenced by faith and custom, while cultural beliefs are often built on a community\u2019s underlying religious or spiritual beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that, in her partial dissent, O\u2019Regan J had the following to say in relation to the right to religion and culture: She contends that although it is not easy to divine a sharp dividing line between the two, it does seem to me that our Constitution recognises that culture is not the same as religion, and should not always be treated as if it is. Religion is dealt with without mention of culture in <b>section 15</b>, which entrenches the right to freedom of belief and conscience. By associating religion with belief and conscience, which involve an individual\u2019s state of mind, religion is understood in an individualist sense: a set of beliefs that an individual may hold regardless of the beliefs of others. The exclusion of culture from <b>section 15</b> suggests that culture is different. The inclusion of culture in <b>section 30</b> and <b>section 31</b> makes it clear that by and large culture as conceived in our Constitution, involves associative practices and not individual beliefs. So, <b>section 31</b> speaks of the right of persons who are members of religious, linguistic or cultural communities \u201cwith other members of that community\u201d to enjoy their culture.</p> \n\n<p>However, religion, according to O\u2019Regan J, need not be associative at all. A religious belief can be entirely personal. The importance of a personal religious belief is more often than not based on a particular relationship with a deity or deities that may have little bearing on community or associative practices. Where one is dealing with personal and individualised belief, religion is to be considered differently to culture, as the Constitution makes clear. In such circumstances, it is appropriate for a court to ask whether the belief is sincerely held in order to decide whether a litigant has established that it falls within the scope of section 15. If a sincere religious belief is established, it seems correct that a court will not investigate the belief further as the cases cited by the Chief Justice in his judgment make plain. A religious belief is personal, and need not be rational, nor need it be shared by others.

The Court emphasized that it was only considering the use, possession or cultivation of cannabis by an adult in private for personal consumption. ", "interpretation": "In the unanimous judgment written by Zondo ACJ, the scope of the right to privacy was discussed with reference to the strong protection afforded to a person\u2019s intimate personal space in South African jurisprudence and foreign law judgments. The Court then agreed with the High Court that the right to privacy affords an adult the right to cultivate and possess cannabis in private for their private consumption and to the extent that the impugned provisions criminalise such cultivation, possession or use, the right to privacy is limited. The limitation of the right to privacy was also not disputed by the applicants in the Constitutional Court.\r\n\r\n<p>The Court then turned its analysis to whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution. In considering the link between the limitation and its purpose and less restrictive means to achieve the purpose, the Court highlighted that the High Court\u2019s decision was influenced by the fact that many democratic societies have legalised or decriminalised the possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court analysed  each of the provisions and held that the focus should not be on a private dwelling only as there are other \u201cprivate places\u201d other than a person\u2019s home or dwelling where cultivation, or prohibiting the use of possession of cannabis would infringe on a persons\u2019 right to privacy. For instance, cultivating cannabis in a private garden.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Court also held that some of the impugned provisions included the prohibition of \u201cpurchase\u201d of cannabis. Although the High Court did not provide reasons why such provisions could be a reasonable limitation on the right to privacy, the Court held that it could not sanction the dealing in cannabis, considering the extent of the problem in South Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court therefore dismissed the appeal and confirmed that the impugned provisions unjustifiably infringed on the right to privacy to the extent provided for in the order. The Court as stated above did not agree with the High Court\u2019s order that the order should be limited to \u201ca private dwelling\u201d and replaced reference thereto with \u201cin private\u201d and in the case of cultivation with \u201cin a private place\u201d.

", "facts_and_issues": "The Constitutional Court consolidated and heard three matters, all concerned with the constitutional validity of laws that prevented owners from transferring (i.e. selling) their property where charges for water and electricity supplied to occupants of the property remain unpaid. <b>Section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Local Government: Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000 (Municipal Systems Act)</em> and <b>section 50(1)(a)</em> of the <em>Gauteng Local Government Ordinance No 17 of 1939 (the Ordinance)</em> both precluded the transfer of immovable property unless all electricity and water consumption charges owing to a municipality for a specific period and in connection with the property were paid; and these included charges owed by any and all occupiers. Transfer of any property may not be approved without a clearance certificate issued by the municipality as proof that such consumption charges have been paid. At the core of the challenge was that these provisions gave rise to arbitrary deprivation of property and violated the protection afforded in terms of <b>section 25(1) of the Constitution</b>. The South Eastern Cape Local Division of the High Court (the High Court) declared <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> unconstitutional in the Mkontwana matter and Bisset matter and these matters were referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm the confirmation of constitutional invalidity. In both these matters the Minister responsible for Local Government opposed the confirmation and appealed the High Court\u2019s order. The third matter, the Transfer Rights Action Campaign matter concerned an application for direct access to the Constitutional Court, relating to the constitutionality of national, provincial and local government legislation including <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em>.

The majority judgment by Yacoob J confirmed that these provisions are not only limited to the non-payment of consumption charges due by the owner, but also extends to the non-payment of consumption charges due by occupiers other than the owner.", "interpretation": "The Court then turned to the question whether these provisions resulted in a deprivation of property. <b>Section 25(1)(a) of the Constitution</b> strictly provides protection against deprivation of property and provides that \u201cno law may permit arbitrary deprivation of property\u201d. The Court recognised that almost all the parties were in agreement that <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> and <b>section 50(1)(a)</b> of the <em>Ordinance</em> brought about deprivation of property. The Court dismissed the argument that these provisions were only regulatory in nature and held that a <b>\u201csubstantial interference\u201d</b> with the enjoyment or use of property that goes beyond the normal restrictions would amount to deprivation. The deprivation here was that owners were unable to transfer their properties unless consumption charges due by people other than themselves and for which they were not liable had been paid. The Court then turned to whether this deprivation was arbitrary. \n\n<p>The Court held that there must be <b>\u201csufficient reason\u201d</b> for the deprivation or else it would be arbitrary, and the greater the deprivation the more compelling the reason for such deprivation must be. The Court reasoned that the requirement served the important purpose of encouraging payment and considering the various categories of occupiers, the owner is usually in a position to take reasonable steps to prevent the unreasonable accumulation of outstanding consumption charges. It was therefore reasonable for the owner to bear this risk. Even in the case of unlawful occupiers, the owner is in the position to take reasonable steps to ensure it is not unlawfully occupied, by securing the property and instituting eviction proceedings to ensure such occupiers do not remain on the property for long. The deprivation in question related to one element of ownership (the right to alienate property). The Court emphasised that this was not an insubstantial deprivation as the provision requires the owner of the property to bear the risk of non-payment of consumption charges by non-owner occupiers. The Court stated that the relationship between the owner, the property and the consumption charge was sufficiently close to require the owner to bear the risk of non-payment and <b>section 118(1)</b> was not found to be arbitrary, Similarly, in cases of unlawful occupation the burden placed on the owner was held not to render <b>section 118(1)</b> arbitrary.</p>\n\n<p>The Court also held that that procedural fairness necessitates that all municipalities must, on the written request of owners, provide owners with copies of electricity and water accounts sent to occupiers.</p>", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "MlungwanaandOthersvSandAnotherZACCBCLRCCSACRCC", "href": "\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2018/45.html", "title": "Mlungwana and Others v S and Another [2018] ZACC 45; 2019 (1) BCLR 88 (CC); 2019 (1) SACR 429 (CC)\n", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2018-11-19T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_17__Assembly,_Demonstration,_PIcket_and_Petition", "sec_18__Freedom_of_Association"], "snippet": "The Constitutional Court had to consider whether section 12(1)(a) of the Act limited section 17 of the Constitution and if so whether the limitation was reasonable and justifiable in terms of section 36 of the Constitution.", "facts_and_issues": "The matter was referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm an order of constitutional invalidity made by the High Court, Western Cape division.The High Court declared <b>section 12(1)(a)</b> of the <b>Regulation of Gatherings Act 205 of 1993 (Act)</b> unconstitutional and invalid as it unjustifiably limited section 17 of the Constitution, the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed.

One of the defences raised by the applicants during the trial was the constitutional validity of section 12(1)(a) of the Act and the Magistrates\u2019 Court granted the applicants leave to appeal to the High Court to challenge the constitutionality of this provision. The High Court found section 12(1)(a) of the Act had a \u201cchilling\u201d and deterring effect on the section 17 of the Constitution and unjustifiably limited the right.

Following a generous interpretation of section 17 of the Constitution, anything that would prevent people from assembling peacefully and unarmed would limit the right.\r\n\r\n<p>The Court at this stage of the analysis also dismissed the respondents\u2019 claim that section 12(1)(a) of the Act merely regulates the right as the criminal sanction created by this provision is a deterrence to exercising the right enshrined in section 17 of the Constitution. The Court found that section 12(1)(a) limited section 17 of the Constitution and turned to consider whether this limitation could be justified in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On analysing the limitation in terms of the factors listed in section 36(1) of the Constitution, the Court on considering the nature of the right, recognised that the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed is central to South Africa\u2019s constitutional democracy. The Court emphasised that the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed is a powerful tool for people who lack both political and economic power to have their voices heard and that the right enables people to exercise other constitutional rights. The Court found that there was a weak link between the criminal sanction and the achievement of section 12(1)(a)\u2019s purpose of preventing violent protests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On considering the nature and extent of the limitation, the Court held that the limitation is severe for the following reasons:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i)\tthe definitions of \u201cgatherings\u201d and \u201cconveners\u201d in the Act are overly broad;</p> \r\n<p>ii)\tcriminalization can result in punishment, moral stigma, and a criminal record for at least ten years;</p> \r\n<p>iii)\tcriminalisation not only has a severe impact on the person sanctioned but also has a wider far-reaching effect on those who wish to protest;</p> \r\n<p>iv)\twhere there is no convener, any person who plays a role (whether it is minor or major) in planning the protest can be held criminally liable; and</p>\r\n<p>v)\tthe limitation does not distinguish between adult and minor conveners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court held that there were other less restrictive means that could have been imposed such as administrative fines or imposing civil liability. The Court confirmed that section 12(1)(a) unjustifiably limited section 17 of the Constitution and declared section 12(1)(a) unconstitutional in its entirety. The Court emphasised that the declaration of invalidity must not understood as implying that the right to assemble can be exercised in any way other than peacefully and unarmed.

Any intrusion upon consensual acts which cause no harm within this sphere breaches the right to privacy. The fact that both the rights to equality and privacy were breached emphasized how severely the rights of gay persons had been violated. \r\n\r\n<p>The Court then turned to <b>section 36(1)</b> to determine whether this limitation could be upheld as a justifiable limitation.

On the municipality\u2019s version, the occupiers had been living on the land for periods ranging from two to eight years and had not applied to the municipality for housing. The occupiers  indicated that they were willing to leave the property if given reasonable notice and provided suitable alternative land to which they could move. The occupiers were told they could move to a place referred to as Walmer Township (Walmer), however they rejected the proposal saying the area was crime-ridden and over-crowded and further that they feared they would have no security of occupation there and find themselves liable to further eviction. The municipality argued that if alternative land was made available to them, they would be disrupting the housing programme and forcing the municipality to grant them preferential treatment. The Municipality applied to the South Eastern Cape Local Division of the High Court for an eviction order against the occupiers and the Court ordered the occupiers to vacate the land and authorised the Sheriff to demolish the structures. The occupiers then appealed the High Court\u2019s order to the SCA. The SCA held that the availability of alternative land was a key factor in the matter and considering that it was unclear whether Walmer was owned by the State or privately, the High Court should not have made this order without confirming whether there would be security of tenure for the occupiers when relocated.", "right_and_principle": "The Constitutional Court had to determine whether the decision of the SCA to set aside the eviction order should be overturned. The Municipality sought confirmation from the Court that the Municipality is not constitutionally bound to provide alternative accommodation of land when it seeks an eviction of unlawful occupiers.", "interpretation": "In a unanimous judgment by Sachs J, the court held that when dealing with constitutionally protected rights, it is important to uphold the values of human dignity, equality and freedom. One of the provisions of the Bill of Rights that has to be interpreted with these values in mind, is <b>section 25</b>, which provides the right to property. This matter accordingly turned on determining the constitutional relationship between <b>section 25</b> and <b>section 26</b>. Sections 25 and 26 create an overlap between land rights and socio-economic rights and it is the duty of the state to fulfil both rights. The court held that the provisions of <b>section 25, subsections 4-9</b> must be borne in mind whenever <b>section 25</b> was being construed; this is because under the Constitution, the protection of property as an individual right was not absolute but subject to societal considerations. The Court also held that the state has a duty to satisfy both property and housing rights provided for in <b>sections 25 and 26 of the Constitution and must seek to balance these rights</b> Section 26(3) of the Constitution demonstrates special constitutional consideration for a person\u2019s home and acknowledges that a home is more than just a shelter from the elements, but is also an area of personal intimacy and family security. \n\n<p>The Court furthermore held that the <em>Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act 19 of 1998 (PIE)</em> cannot simply be looked at as a legislative mechanism to re-establish common law property rights. The first part of the title of PIE emphasised a shift in focus from preventing illegal squatting to preventing illegal evictions. Under PIE squatting was decriminalised and evictions were subject to requirements in line with the Bill of Rights. The provisions of PIE must be considered against the values of South Africa\u2019s new constitutional dispensation. In making its decision, the court must consider all relevant circumstances, including the manner in which occupation was effected, its duration and the availability of suitable alternative accommodation or land, the motivation for settling on land, the degree of desperation of people who have sought land, and whether people occupied land with a plausible belief that they have permission to be there (as opposed to those who deliberately invade land to deliberately disrupt the organised housing programme and place themselves at the front of the queue). Regarding suitable alternative accommodation, the Court emphasised that this will vary from municipality to municipality and depends on the number of people facing eviction in each case and whether the municipality is able to secure suitable accommodation for unlawful occupiers without prejudicing the claims of lawful occupiers and those in line for formal housing.</p>\n\n<p>The Court held that considering the period which the occupiers have lived on the land, the fact that eviction is not necessary for the land to be used productively and that this is a relatively small group of people who appear to be genuinely homeless and in need, it would not be just and equitable to order the eviction.

Section 26(1) of the Interim Constitution guaranteed every person \u201cthe right to freely engage in economic activity and to pursue a livelihood in the national territory\u201d. Section 26(2) held that this does not preclude the designing of measures \u201cto promote the protection or the improvement of the quality of life, economic growth, human development, social justice, basic conditions of employment, fair labour practices or equal opportunity for all, provided such measures are justifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality\u201d.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court emphasised that section 26(2) requires there to be a rational connection between the law and the purpose for which it was enacted and if the purpose is sanctioned by subsection 2, the second question is whether it is justifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality. In this matter the Court held that the legislature was mandated to \u201ccombat social ills\u201d and the means chosen to regulate this fell within the scope of Parliament. Parliament had a wide discretion in choosing how to combat social problems, including through the creation of new offences. Furthermore, the courts must give effect to legislative choices made by Parliament except where the choices are not in line with the Constitution. The Court emphasised that it cannot declare legislation invalid merely because it views it as ineffective or because there were better means of addressing the problem. The majority held that sex work and brothel keeping were not protected by section 26 of the Interim Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minority judgment by O\u2019Regan J and Sachs J, acknowledged that the challenges to section 26 of the Interim Constitution provides two possible interpretations.

The minority agreed that criminalisation of sex work did not infringe the rights to human dignity and economic activity, and that any limitation on privacy was reasonably justifiable.

He required dialysis two to three times a week. Due to his financial circumstances, he applied to a provincial state hospital to receive the treatment. However, the hospital only had 20 dialysis machines available and because of the limited resources had a strict policy regarding access to renal dialysis. Only patients that suffered from acute renal failure and were eligible for a kidney transplant were given access. Due to the nature of his illness, the appellant was denied treatment and he applied to the Durban High Court for an order directing Addington Hospital to provide him with ongoing dialysis and treatment and interdicting the hospital from refusing him admission to the renal unit.

The Court emphasised that the right to not be refused emergency medical treatment related to the right to receive immediate medical attention  following a sudden catastrophe and not to be turned away from a hospital that is able to provide the necessary treatment. The appellant had a chronic and irreversible medical condition and needed renal dialysis two to three times a week and this did not constitute an emergency in terms of <b>section 27(3) of the Constitution</b>.

The Court affirmed that the rights that individuals enjoy in terms of section 27 of the Constitution are dependent upon the resources available for such purposes, and that the corresponding rights themselves are limited by the lack of resources. The Court found that the provincial health department\u2019s resources were already severely strained and that if the Court were to decide that treatment had to be provided to Mr Soobramoney it would also have to be provided to all others in a similar position and the resources available to the hospital could not accommodate the demand. Furthermore, the cost of providing renal dialysis twice a week to a single patient is R60 000 per annum and to expand the programme to cover everyone who requires renal dialysis would make substantial inroads into the health budget and prejudice other obligations which the state has to meet.</p>\r\n\n<p>The Court held that the responsibility for making the difficult decisions of fixing the health budget and deciding upon the priorities that needed to be met lay with political organs and the medical authorities and added that the Court would be slow to interfere with such decisions if they were rational and taken in good faith. The Court concluded that it had not been shown that the state\u2019s failure to provide renal dialysis facilities for all persons suffering from chronic renal failure constitutes a breach of its constitutional obligations.</p>\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the Court found that the government hospital\u2019s refusal to provide him with dialysis did not violate section 27(1) of the nor section 27(3) of the Constitution.</p>", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "SouthAfricanBroadcastingCorporationLimitedvNationalDirectorofPublicProsecutionsandOthers", "href": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2006/15.html", "title": "South African Broadcasting Corporation Limited v National Director of Public Prosecutions and Others", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2006-09-21T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_16__Freedom_of_Expression"], "snippet": "The issue before the Constitutional Court was whether the Court should interfere with the Supreme Court of Appeal\u2019s discretion in terms of section 173 of the Constitution to regulate its own process and order that full audio recordings and broadcasting of the appeal proceedings be allowed.", "facts_and_issues": "The applicant was appealing a judgment made by the Supreme Court of Appeal where the court granted permission only to broadcast visuals of the respondents pending trial, but without sound.

In spite of these precautionary measures, the gathering resulted in riot damage. The respondents claim that as a consequence of this gathering, their shops were vandalised and looted, and their property was damaged. The respondents instituted action for damages against the applicants in terms of section 11(1) of the Regulations of Gatherings Act. Section 11(1) of the Regulations of Gatherings Act provides for liability for riot damage against the convener of such gathering and section 11(2) provides a limited defence to such convener of the riot damage on the basis that the damage \u201cwas not reasonably foreseeable\u201d and that it took all \u201creasonable steps to prevent the act in question\u201d.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the High Court, the applicants denied liability for the riot damage and challenged the constitutionality of the words \u201cand was not reasonably foreseeable\u201d in section 11(2)(b) of the Regulations of Gatherings Act.

The Court had to determine whether the defence created in terms of section 11(2) of the Regulations of Gatherings Act was rational and if so, whether the defence limited section 17 of the Constitution and whether such limitation was justifiable.", "interpretation": "Mogoeng CJ, writing for the majority considered the rationality attack on the defence contained in section 11(2). The applicants\u2019 argued that it was not rational for a convener of a gathering to take all reasonable steps to prevent an act or omission even if that act or omission was not reasonably foreseeable. Mogoeng CJ, considered the meaning of the provision and held that there is a connection between the steps that a convener takes, within its power, and preventing harm that is reasonably foreseeable. If appropriate steps are adopted when planning a gathering and these steps are reasonable to prevent foreseeable outcomes, the taking of such steps would render any act or omission that resulted in riot damage to be classified as reasonably unforeseeable. The defence was therefore found to be rational.\r\n\r\n<p>Mogoeng CJ, then turned to considered whether the provision limited section 17 of the Constitution. Mogoeng J held that section 11(2) of the Regulation of Gatherings Act does limit section 17 of the Constitution as it requires conveners of gatherings to adhere to the requirements and can potentially increase the cost of organising a protest which could bar under-resourced organisations from being able to protest. The question was whether this limitation could be justified in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution as a reasonable and justifiable limitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On conducting the limitation analysis in terms of section 36 of the Constitution, and looking at the importance of the right to assemble, the Court emphasised that the right to freedom of assembly is central to our constitutional democracy. It exists to give a voice to less powerful people in society and groups that do not wield political or economic power and other vulnerable persons. The right may be the only mechanism for such persons to express their concerns. Bearing in mind the significance of this right, the purpose of the limitation must be important enough to justify the limitation. The Court held that the purpose of the limitation, to protect individuals, especially those who themselves are under-resourced, who suffer damages caused by protests, is a crucial one. The Court reasoned that the public has no means to control protests whereas organisers are in a position to control and manage protests. Organizations have a choice between exercising the right to assemble or abandoning protests in order to prevent reasonably foreseeable damage. Conversely, victims of riot damage have no choice regarding what may happen to them or their property.

First, it is as a guiding principle in each case that deals with a particular child. Secondly, it is a standard against which to test provisions or conduct which affect children in general. The Court added that the best-interests principle is not only limited to scenarios where legislation is inflexible, the principle also applies in circumstances where a statutory provision is shown to be against the best interests of children in general, for whatever reason. As a matter of logic what is bad for all children will be bad for one child in a particular case. Thus, if there is evidence that exposing children to the criminal justice system for engaging in consensual sexual behaviour has a negative impact on them generally, then a Court may declare the scheme to be contrary to the best interests of the child in terms of section 28(2), and therefore invalid.</p> \n\n<p>Therefore, <b>section 28</b> is both a self-standing right and a guiding principle in respect of all matters affecting the child. What is in the best interests of the child in each case will require a consideration of various factors. Further, it is not necessary that the specific interests of the child in the case before the court are affected, but rather whether the interests of children in general are affected. Legislation would be inconsistent with this right if it is demonstrated to be against the interests of children in general.</p>\n\n<p>In a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court found that sections 15 and 16 of the Act were unconstitutional in that they infringed the rights of adolescents (12- to 16-year olds) to dignity and privacy, and further in that they violated the best-interests principle contained in <b>section 28(2) of the Constitution</b>. The Court held that the sections infringed the best-interests principle in many ways. Most importantly, the offences created by the provisions ran the risk of exposing children to the harmful effects of the criminal justice system and could undermine support structures by deterring adolescents from seeking help and could create a breakdown in parental care.<p>\n\n<p>Relying on expert evidence, the Court concluded that the provisions criminalized what constituted developmentally normal conduct for adolescents, and adversely affected the very children the Act sought to protect. The effects of the provisions were found not to be rationally related to the State\u2019s purpose of protecting children. The Court then found that the infringement of the best-interests principle cannot be justified in terms of section 36 of the Constitution as was no evidence that criminalising such consensual sexual behaviour would deter adolescents from engaging in it.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the Constitutional Court declared the sections 15 and 16 of the Act invalid to the extent that they criminalized consensual sexual conduct between adolescents.<p>\n\n<p>The Constitutional Court suspended the declaration of invalidity for 18 months to allow Parliament to amend the provisions. The Court further ordered a suspension on all investigations, arrests, prosecutions and criminal and ancillary proceedings (regarding adolescents) in relation to sections 15 and 16 of the Act, until Parliament remedied the defects identified. Finally, the Minister was ordered to take the necessary steps to ensure that the details of any adolescent convicted of an offence in terms of sections 15 or 16 of the Act will not appear in the National Register for Sex Offenders and that such an adolescent will have his or her criminal record removed.</p>\n", "citedCases": [""]}, {"id": "TheCitizenPtyLtdandOthersvMcBride", "href": "\r\nhttp://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2011/11.html\r\r", "title": "The Citizen 1978 (Pty) Ltd and Others v McBride", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2011-04-08T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_10__Human_Dignity"], "snippet": "The key issue the Constitutional Court had to determine was how amnesty granted to the respondent for crimes committed (during the struggle against apartheid) by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission affected a claim for defamation.

The majority emphasised that the right to human dignity is not only given separate constitutional recognition in section 10 of the Constitution but is also one of the founding values of the Constitution in section 1. Therefore, a failure to uphold the right is not only a violation of section 10 but is also a threat to a founding value underpinning the legitimacy of the State. The majority stated that freedom of expression is just as important as human dignity and one cannot say that human dignity trumps freedom of expression. Therefore, the Court held that the law of defamation must be interpreted to give effect to the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression, on the one hand, and a person\u2019s human dignity on the other.

Kondile AJ, writing for the majority, started the equality analysis by firstly considering, whether the provision differentiated between categories of people and if there was such differentiation whether there was a legitimate rationale for such differentiation. During this first leg of the analysis, looking at the rational connection between the provision and its purpose, the Court emphasised that the private security industry was a special environment and at stake was the safety and security of the public at large. <b>Section 12 of the Constitution</b> provides everyone with the right to freedom and security of the person, which includes the right to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources. In a society rife with violent crime, the importance of protecting this right could not be exaggerated.\n\n<p>The majority judgment held that the regulatory scheme was carefully designed for the purpose of screening entrants to the private security industry rather than constituting a blanket ban on the registration of refugees as private security service providers. That is not to say that foreign nationals, including refugees, are inherently less trustworthy than South Africans. In a country where xenophobia has caused increased suffering, it was important to stress this and explain that it was not that the Authority did not trust refugees. The Security Act was designed to limit eligibility for registration to people whose trustworthiness could be objectively verified, and it was easier to verify the trustworthiness of citizens and permanent residents. The preamble to the Act acknowledges that the right to security of the person is fundamental to the well-being and to the social and economic development of every person. The Court therefore held that the differentiation between citizens and permanent residents on one hand and other foreigners in this instance, was rational and served a legitimate government purpose.</p> \n\n<p>On establishing differentiation, the majority judgment then considered whether the differentiation amounted to discrimination. The Court held that in this instance, the differentiation was on grounds analogous to those listed in section 9(3) of the Constitution, and therefore constituted discrimination. The analysis then turned to whether the discrimination was unfair. Various factors were considered by the Court on the question of fairness, such as the fact that  while refugees were fully entitled to work in South Africa, <b>section 22 of the Constitution</b> limited the right to choose a job to citizens only. The Court also considered that refugees could be registered as security service providers if the requirements of section 23(6) of the Security Act were met and that there was no complete exclusion of refugees from being registered. The majority found that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act did not unfairly discriminate against the applicants and was therefore constitutionally sound.</p>\n\n<p>In their dissenting judgment, Mokgoro J and O'Regan J held that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act discriminated unfairly on the basis of refugee status. The joint dissenting judgment was not convinced that the purpose identified by the Minister to ensure that security service employees were trustworthy was really intended by the section. The dissenting judgment stated that the order it would have proposed was to require that refugees who could meet the other requirements of the Security Act should not be barred from registration as security service providers.
