The Court held that <strong>section 8(2)</strong> makes it expressly clear that the rights contained in the Bill of Rights such as the right to basic education, can, depending on the nature of the right, be applied to bind private parties. Thus, <strong>section 8(2)</strong> imposes constitutional obligations on private entities, such as Pridwin. In subjecting power exercised by private (non-State) parties to constitutional control, <strong>section 8(2)</strong> recognises the importance of private interactions and their potential to violate human rights and to perpetuate inequality and disadvantage.</p>\n<p>The Court then found that independent schools provide \u2018basic education\u2019, in terms of <strong>section 29 of the Constitution</strong>, to learners as the nature of the entity providing education is not relevant to determining whether what is offered is \u201cbasic education\u201d. Therefore, <strong>section 29(1)(a)</strong> is an overarching right to basic education that applies to all persons and is enjoyed by children at public and independent schools alike.</p>\n<p>With respect to the second issue, the Court held that a decision to discontinue a learner\u2019s education would be unconstitutional and therefore invalid if the school did not give an opportunity to the learners or their parents/guardian or representatives to make representations before the decision was made by the school to terminate the parent contract and remove the child from the school. The Court held that this is premised on the fact that <strong>section 29 of the Constitution</strong> places an obligation on all schools, both private and government schools, to not impair or interfere with the right to basic education. In this case, the school was unable to demonstrate appropriate reasons for limiting the rights of the applicants to basic education without providing an opportunity to the applicants to make representations to the school before the decision to remove the children from the school had been taken. The Court therefore held that the <strong>section 29</strong> right was impaired due to the absence of a fair procedure being followed prior to the termination of the contract. Accordingly, it was declared that that the school had the obligation to consider the rights of the applicants\u2019 children to have their views heard on the matter and to offer this opportunity to them.

But that the Constitution qualifies access to this right. The overarching condition is that the fulfilment of the promise of education in a language of choice must be reasonably practicable. What reasonable practicability means and entails was what the Court had to decide in this matter. \n</p><p>The Court noted that <b>section 29(2)</b> requires <b>\u201c(a) equity; (b) practicability; and (c) the need to redress the results of past racially discriminatory laws and practices,\u201d</b> to feature prominently in exploring the possibility of offering education in an official language of choice.

For they are some of the decisive factors to which regard must be had even where <b>\u201ca learner already enjoys the benefit of being taught in an official language of choice\u201d</b>.

Since this protection is only afforded to child accused and witnesses, there was a gap in the law as it pertained to protecting child victims in criminal proceedings. The Court held that the exclusion of child victims in section 154(3) limited the right to equality, as it constituted a one-sided differentiation that did not offer equal protection and benefit of the law.

The dissenting judgments argued further that the conclusion that the rights to dignity, privacy and the best interests of the child were infringed was hard to understand in the context of the ongoing protection.

Burgerskap het verband gehou met die kern van &#39;n persoon se identiteit, &#39;n gevoel van behoort in &#39;n gemeenskap en met sekuriteit van &#39;n persoon, veral in gemeenskappe vol vreemdelingehaat.

Die Hof het beklemtoon dat apartheidswetgewing beide die reg op toegang tot voldoende behuising en die reg op eiendom ondermyn het. Artikel 25 verbied arbitr&ecirc;re ontneming van eiendom, maar onderneem ook om ongelyke sosiale toestande reg te stel.

Verder het die Hof bevind dat &#39;n sleuteloorweging was of die Stad redelike pogings aangewend het om alternatiewe verblyf aan die okkupeerders te verskaf. Na oorweging van die Stad se behuisingsbeleid, het die Hof opgemerk dat die beleid onderskei tussen persone wat deur die Stad self hervestig is en diegene wat deur private grondeienaars uitgesit is.

Daar is gevind dat die Stad se behuisingsbeleid rigied is. Die Hof het bevind dat die beleid nie in ag neem of noodakkommodasie in individuele gevalle beskikbaar gestel moet word nie, met inagneming van die kategorie&euml; persone wat geraak word (soos bejaardes en kinders) en hul omstandighede, en dat &#39;n dreigende uitsetting hulle dakloos kan maak, ongeag of die uitsetting of hervestiging deur die Stad of &#39;n private grondeienaar aangevra word. Die Hof het bevind dat hierdie onderskeiding nie rasioneel was nie. Waar &#39;n uitsetting tot haweloosheid kan lei, is dit irrelevant of sodanige uitsetting op die Stad of &#39;n private grondeienaar se aanval is. Die Hof het beklemtoon dat hierdie aangeleentheid betrekking het op tydelike akkommodasie in &#39;n noodgeval soos omskryf in Hoofstuk 12 van die Nasionale Behuisingskode en nie permanente behuising nie. Die verpligting, hoewel dit afgelei is van die reg op progressiewe realisering van voldoende behuising ingevolge artikel 26(2) van die Grondwet, is onderskei van die verpligting om permanente behuisingsbehoeftes aan te spreek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Die Hof het dus die Stad se behuisingsbeleid ongrondwetlik en in stryd met artikel 26 van die Grondwet verklaar in die mate dat dit mense wat deur private grondeienaars uitgesit is, uitgesluit het van sy tydelike behuisingsprogram.

Dit is omdat Deel A van Bylae 5 van die Grondwet die funksionele areas van eksklusiewe provinsiale wetgewende bevoegdheid lys en die vyfde item dranklisensies is.

Tweedens, die daarstelling van eenvormige voorwaardes vir nasionale registrasie van vervaardigers en verspreiders. Hier is bevind dat provinsiale eksklusiewe bevoegdheid met betrekking tot dranklisensies nie bedoel was om die vervaardiging en verspreiding van drank te dek nie omdat dit nie &#39;n intra-provinsiale aktiwiteit was nie en dus &#39;n eksklusiewe nasionale bevoegdheid was. Die derde doelwit was om gedetailleerde meganismes aan provinsiale wetgewers voor te skryf vir die daarstelling van kleinhandellisensi&euml;ringsmeganismes.

Die eerste fase behels &#39;n oorweging van die omvang van die grondwetlike reg en die omvang van die betwiste wet ten einde te bepaal of daar &#39;n inbreuk was. Gevolglik het die Hof in hierdie saak eerstens ontleed of artikel 417(2)(b) van die Maatskappywet artikel 11(1) van die Tussentydse Grondwet, wat betrekking het op die reg op vryheid en sekerheid van die persoon, beperk. Die Hof het beklemtoon dat &#39;n wye interpretasie op hierdie stadium aan die reg gegee moet word aangesien die tweede fase van die beperkingstoets wat artikel 33(1) van die Tussentydse Grondwet behels die kriteria voorskryf waaraan voldoen moet word voordat &#39;n verskanste reg regverdigbaar beperk kan word. Die Hof het bevind dat artikel 417(2)(b) artikel 11(1) van die Tussentydse Grondwet beperk en het toe na die tweede fase van die beperkingstoets oorgegaan.

Die Hof het in hierdie saak beklemtoon dat die onus op die party rus wat op die wetgewing staatmaak om die beperking ingevolge artikel 33(1) van die Tussentydse Grondwet te regverdig en nie vir die party wat dit betwis nie.

The Court indicated that one of the types of property included under <b>section 25</b>, in addition to land <b></b>), are physical, moveable things e.g., motor vehicles.

The Court held that the deprivation is arbitrary \u201cwhen the \u2018law\u2019 referred to in section 25(1) does not provide sufficient reason for the particular deprivation in question or is procedurally unfair\u201d. The Court also gave a list of factors to be taken into account to determine whether there is \u2018sufficient reason\u2019, such as the nature and complexity of the relationship between the means and ends; and the nature or type of the right or property in question (i.e. ownership in land or other extensive property rights will require more justification in order to be sufficient).</p>\n\n<p>Following this analysis, the Court held that section 114 of the Act deprived FNB permanently of all its rights and benefits as owner of the vehicles. On applying the test for whether the deprivation was arbitrary or not, and therefore whether the deprivation was constitutional or not, the Court concluded that the deprivation, the seizure by SARS under section 114 of FNB\u2019s vehicles, was arbitrary and unconstitutional because there was insufficient reason justifying it. The Court held that: (i) there was no connection between the debt of the debtors and the owner of the property (FNB); (ii) there was no connection between the debt and the property (FNB\u2019s vehicles); (iii) the property owner (FNB) did not detriment SARS by placing the property (the vehicles) in the possession of the debtor hence there is no reason why the property owner should be subjected to interference or sanction.</p> \n\n<p>The Court therefore found section 114 of the Act unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed SARS to detain and sell seized property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.</p></div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The core of the Constitutional Court\u2019s analysis related to the question whether section 114 of the Act infringed section 25 of the Constitution which provides for the right to property by allowing SARS to seize property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.

Ngcobo J het gemeen dat die Grondwet dit duidelik maak dat Suid-Afrikaanse reg vertolk moet word op &#39;n wyse wat aan internasionale reg voldoen. Met betrekking tot artikel 37 van die Grondwet, het Ngcobo J daarop gewys dat artikel 37(4)(b)(i) vereis dat wetgewing wat afwyk van die Handves van Regte in ooreenstemming moet wees met die Republiek se verpligtinge kragtens internasionale reg wat op noodtoestande van toepassing is. Volgens Ngcobo J dui hierdie bepaling tesame met artikels 39 en 233 van die Grondwet daarop dat internasionale reg &#39;n spesiale plek in ons reg het. Ngcobo J het egter gemeen dat hoewel artikel 7(2) van die Grondwet aanleiding gegee het tot &#39;n verpligting op die staat om korrupsie en georganiseerde misdaad te beveg, dit nie spesifiek &#39;n verpligting op die staat opgel&ecirc; het om &#39;n onafhanklike teenkorrupsie-eenheid te stig nie. Dit het verder bevind dat, in soverre so &#39;n grondwetlike verpligting gevind word, die strukturele en operasionele outonomie van die DPCI verseker is deur institusionele en wetlike meganismes wat voldoende ontwerp is om onbehoorlike inmenging te voorkom en die onafhanklikheid van die DPCI beskerm het.</p>", "right_and_principle": "<p>Die kwessie voor die Hof was of die nasionale wetgewing wat DPCI geskep het en die DSO ontbind het, grondwetlik geldig is.

Die omvang van die staat se verpligting is gedefinieer deur drie sleutelelemente, wat afsonderlik oorweeg moet word: die verpligting om redelike wetgewende en ander maatre&euml;ls te tref; om die progressiewe verwesenliking van artikel 26 te bereik; en binne beskikbare hulpbronne.

Die vorming van &#39;n program was egter slegs die eerste fase in die nakoming van die staat se verpligtinge.

Sachs J het gemeen dat die uitsluiting van selfdegeslagpaartjies van die voordele en verantwoordelikhede van die huwelik nie &#39;n geringe of onbelangrike uitsluiting was nie, maar dit het geprojekteer dat in die o&euml; van die wet selfdegeslagpaartjies buitestaanders is, en dat hul behoefte aan beskerming van hul persoonlike verhoudings as mense was minder waardig as di&eacute; van heteroseksuele paartjies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In die vertolking van die reg op gelykheid, het die Hof beklemtoon dat om mense te penaliseer omdat hulle is wie en wat hulle is, disrespekvol is en die reg op gelykheid geskend word.

Respek vir menseregte vereis die bevestiging van self, nie die ontkenning van self nie. Gelykheid impliseer dus nie &#39;n nivellering of homogenisering van gedrag of die verheerliking van een vorm as oppermagtig, en &#39;n ander as minderwaardig nie, maar &#39;n erkenning en aanvaarding van verskil.

Een van die grondliggende waardes van ons grondwetlike demokrasie is &#39;n veelpartystelsel van demokratiese regering, om aanspreeklikheid, responsiwiteit en openheid te verseker. Hierdie grondliggende waarde moet op die vlak van nasionale, provinsiale en plaaslike regering uitdrukking gegee word. Een van die doelwitte van plaaslike regering is dus om demokratiese en verantwoordbare regering vir plaaslike gemeenskappe te voorsien. Die doel van artikel 155(3)(b) is om teen politieke inmenging te waak in die proses om nuwe munisipaliteite te skep. Want, as munisipaliteite langs partylyne gestig sou word of as daar politieke inmenging in die stigting daarvan sou wees, sou dit ons veelpartystelsel van demokratiese regering ondermyn. &#39;n Doelbewuste besluit is dus geneem om die bevoegdheid om munisipale gebiede te stig aan &#39;n onafhanklike owerheid toe te ken. Om tot hierdie gevolgtrekking te kom, het die Hof sy uitspraak in die Uitvoerende Raad, Western Cape v Minister of Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development oorweeg waar daar bevind is dat grondwetlike gesag om munisipale grense te bepaal uitsluitlik by die Afbakeningsraad berus. Di&eacute; magtiging strek tot alle kategorie&euml; munisipaliteite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Die Hof het bevind dat die Munisipale Afbakeningsraad &#39;n onafhanklike owerheid was wat die bevoegdheid het om munisipale grense te trek. Deur aan hierdie raad die mag te gee, het die Grondwet probeer om politieke inmenging in die proses om munisipale grense te skep, te voorkom. Hierdie bevoegdheid is egter beperk deur die gesag van die Parlement om provinsiale grense te trek. Vir die Hof was dit onvermydelik dat die verandering van provinsiale grense &#39;n impak op munisipale grense sou h&ecirc;. Dit was implisiet in die mag om provinsiale grense te verander. Daarom het die Hof bevind dat die Twaalfde Wysiging nie die Grondwet oortree het deur met munisipale grense in te meng in die loop van die hertrekking van provinsiale grense nie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Met betrekking tot die tweede kwessie het die Hof twyfel geopper of die nasionale wetgewende proses vir grondwetlike wysigings behoorlik gevolg is.

Die Hof het bepaal dat verdere ondersoek nodig is om te bepaal of KwaZulu-Natal aan die Grondwet voldoen het toe die Twaalfde Wysiging aangeneem is.

Artikel 118(1) van die Wet op Plaaslike Regering: Munisipale Stelsels 32 van 2000 (Wet op Munisipale Stelsels) en artikel 50(1)(a) van die Gautengse Ordonnansie op Plaaslike Regering No 17 van 1939 (die Ordonnansie) het albei die oordrag van onroerende eiendom uitgesluit tensy alle elektrisiteits- en waterverbruikskoste verskuldig aan &#39;n munisipaliteit vir &#39;n spesifieke tydperk en in verband met die eiendom betaal is; en dit het kostes ingesluit wat deur enige en alle okkupeerders verskuldig is. Oordrag van enige eiendom mag nie goedgekeur word sonder &#39;n klaringsertifikaat wat deur die munisipaliteit uitgereik is as bewys dat sodanige verbruiksheffings betaal is nie.

Artikel 25(1)(a) van die Grondwet bied streng beskerming teen ontneming van eiendom en bepaal dat geen wet arbitr&ecirc;re ontneming van eiendom mag toelaat nie. Die Hof het erken dat byna al die partye dit eens was dat artikel 118(1) van die Munisipale Stelselswet en artikel 50(1)(a) van die Ordonnansie ontneming van eiendom meegebring het. Die Hof het die argument dat hierdie bepalings slegs regulerend van aard was, van die hand gewys en bevind dat &#39;n wesenlike inmenging met die genot of gebruik van eiendom wat verder gaan as die normale beperkings, op ontneming sou neerkom. Die ontneming hier was dat eienaars nie in staat was om hul eiendomme oor te dra nie, tensy verbruikskoste verskuldig deur mense anders as hulleself en waarvoor hulle nie aanspreeklik was nie, betaal is. Die Hof het toe gedraai of hierdie ontneming arbitr&ecirc;r was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Die Hof het bevind dat daar voldoende rede vir die ontneming moet wees, anders sou dit arbitr&ecirc;r wees, en hoe groter die ontneming, hoe meer dwingend moet die rede vir sodanige ontneming wees. Die Hof het geredeneer dat die vereiste die belangrike doel dien om betaling aan te moedig en met inagneming van die verskillende kategorie&euml; van okkupeerders, is die eienaar gewoonlik in &#39;n posisie om redelike stappe te neem om die onredelike ophoping van uitstaande verbruiksheffings te voorkom. Dit was dus redelik dat die eienaar hierdie risiko moes dra. Selfs in die geval van onwettige okkupeerders, is die eienaar in die posisie om redelike stappe te neem om te verseker dat dit nie onwettig beset word nie, deur die eiendom te beveilig en uitsettingsverrigtinge in te stel om te verseker dat sulke okkupeerders nie lank op die eiendom bly nie. Die betrokke ontneming het betrekking op een element van eienaarskap (die reg om eiendom te vervreem). Die Hof het beklemtoon dat dit nie &#39;n wesenlike ontneming was nie aangesien die bepaling vereis dat die eienaar van die eiendom die risiko van nie-betaling van verbruiksheffings deur nie-eienaar okkupeerders dra. Die Hof het verklaar dat die verhouding tussen die eienaar, die eiendom en die verbruiksheffing voldoende naby was om te vereis dat die eienaar die risiko van wanbetaling dra en artikel 118(1) is nie as arbitr&ecirc;r bevind nie, Net so, in gevalle van onwettige beroep is die las wat op die eienaar geplaas is, beskou om artikel 118(1) nie arbitr&ecirc;r te maak nie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Die Hof het ook bevind dat prosedurele billikheid dit noodsaak dat alle munisipaliteite, op skriftelike versoek van eienaars, eienaars moet voorsien van afskrifte van elektrisiteit- en waterrekeninge wat aan okkupeerders gestuur word.</p>", "right_and_principle": "<p>Een van die kernkwessies wat die Konstitusionele Hof moes bepaal, was of artikel 118(1) van die Munisipale Stelselswet en artikel 50(1)(a) van die Ordonnansie met artikel 25 van die Grondwet strook.

Privaat feite is beskryf as sake wat, indien dit bekend gemaak word, geestelike nood en besering aan enigiemand in dieselfde omstandighede sou veroorsaak en verkieslik privaat gehou moet word.

Die Hof het beklemtoon dat &#39;n individu se MIV-status beskerming verdien teen ongeregverdigde openbaarmaking as gevolg van die negatiewe sosiale konnotasies wat met die siekte geassosieer word en potensi&euml;le diskriminasie.

Dit bestaan om &#39;n stem te gee aan minder magtige mense in die samelewing en groepe wat nie politieke of ekonomiese mag het nie en ander kwesbare persone. Die reg is dalk die enigste meganisme vir sulke persone om hul bekommernisse uit te spreek. Met die betekenis van hierdie reg in gedagte, moet die doel van die beperking belangrik genoeg wees om die beperking te regverdig. Die hof het bevind dat die doel van die beperking, om individue te beskerm, veral diegene wat self te min hulpbronne het, en wat skade ly wat deur betogings veroorsaak word, &#39;n deurslaggewende een is. Die hof het geredeneer dat die publiek geen manier het om betogings te beheer nie, terwyl organiseerders in &#39;n posisie is om betogings te beheer en te bestuur. Organisasies het &#39;n keuse tussen die uitoefening van die reg om byeen te kom of om betogings te laat vaar om redelikerwys voorsienbare skade te voorkom. Omgekeerd het slagoffers van onlustebeskadiging geen keuse oor wat met hulle of hul eiendom kan gebeur nie. Daarom het die Hof beslis dat die regverdiging waarvoor die wet voorsiening maak, lewensvatbaar is en dat die beperking op die reg op vryheid van vergadering in artikel 17 van die Grondwet as redelik en regverdigbaar beskou word. Die Hof het beklemtoon dat die Wet op die Regulering van Byeenkomste nie die reg op vryheid van vergadering tot niet maak nie, maar streng voorwaardes aan die reg stel ten einde skade aan persone of eiendom te voorkom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In &#39;n ooreenstemmende uitspraak het Jafta J beslis dat die app&egrave;l van die hand gewys moet word, op grond daarvan dat die applikante versuim het om te bewys dat artikel 11(2) van die Wet op die Regulasies van Byeenkomste die reg op vryheid van vergadering beperk.

Artikel 26(1) van die Tussentydse Grondwet het aan elke persoon die reg gewaarborg om vrylik aan ekonomiese aktiwiteit deel te neem en om &#39;n bestaan in die nasionale grondgebied na te streef. Artikel 26(2) het bepaal dat dit nie die ontwerp van maatre&euml;ls uitsluit om die beskerming of verbetering van die lewenskwaliteit, ekonomiese groei, menslike ontwikkeling, sosiale geregtigheid, basiese diensvoorwaardes, billike arbeidspraktyke of gelyke geleenthede vir almal te bevorder nie. , mits sulke maatre&euml;ls regverdigbaar is in &#39;n oop en demokratiese samelewing gebaseer op vryheid en gelykheid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Die Hof het beklemtoon dat artikel 26(2) vereis dat daar &#39;n rasionele verband moet wees tussen die wet en die doel waarvoor dit uitgevaardig is en indien die doel deur subartikel 2 gesanksioneer word, is die tweede vraag of dit regverdigbaar is in &#39;n oop en demokratiese samelewing gebaseer op vryheid en gelykheid. In hierdie aangeleentheid het die Hof bevind dat die wetgewer mandaat gehad het om maatskaplike euwels te bekamp en die middele wat gekies is om dit te reguleer, val binne die bestek van die Parlement. Die parlement het &#39;n wye diskresie gehad in die keuse van hoe om maatskaplike probleme te bekamp, insluitend deur die skep van nuwe oortredings. Verder moet die howe uitvoering gee aan wetgewende keuses wat deur die Parlement gemaak word, behalwe waar die keuses nie in lyn is met die Grondwet nie. Die Hof het beklemtoon dat hy nie wetgewing ongeldig kan verklaar bloot omdat hy dit as ondoeltreffend beskou of omdat daar beter maniere was om die probleem aan te spreek nie.

Eerstens is dit as riglyn in elke geval wat oor &#39;n bepaalde kind handel. Tweedens is dit &#39;n standaard waarteen bepalings of gedrag wat kinders in die algemeen raak, getoets kan word. Die Hof het bygevoeg dat die beginsel van beste belang nie net beperk is tot scenario&#39;s waar wetgewing onbuigsaam is nie; die beginsel geld ook in omstandighede waar bewys word dat &#39;n statut&ecirc;re bepaling teen die beste belange van kinders in die algemeen is, om watter rede ook al. As &#39;n kwessie van logika wat sleg is vir alle kinders sal sleg wees vir een kind in &#39;n spesifieke geval. Dus, indien daar bewyse is dat die blootstelling van kinders aan die strafregstelsel vir deelname aan konsensuele seksuele gedrag &#39;n negatiewe impak op hulle in die algemeen het, dan kan &#39;n Hof verklaar dat die skema teenstrydig is met die beste belange van die kind ingevolge artikel 28 (2), en dus ongeldig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daarom is artikel 28 beide &#39;n selfstandige reg en &#39;n leidende beginsel ten opsigte van alle aangeleenthede wat die kind raak.

Verder is dit nie nodig dat die spesifieke belange van die kind in die saak voor die hof aangetas word nie, maar eerder of die belange van kinders in die algemeen aangetas word.

Die Hof het bevind dat die artikels op baie maniere die beste-belang-beginsel skend. Belangriker nog, die misdrywe wat deur die bepalings geskep word, het die gevaar geloop om kinders aan die skadelike gevolge van die strafregstelsel bloot te stel en kan ondersteuningstrukture ondermyn deur adolessente te weerhou om hulp te soek en kan &#39;n ineenstorting in ouerlike sorg veroorsaak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deur op deskundige getuienis te vertrou, het die Hof tot die gevolgtrekking gekom dat die bepalings dit wat ontwikkelingsnormale gedrag vir adolessente uitmaak, kriminaliseer en die einste kinders wat die Wet wou beskerm, nadelig be&iuml;nvloed. Daar is gevind dat die uitwerking van die bepalings nie rasioneel verband hou met die Staat se doel om kinders te beskerm nie. Die Hof het toe bevind dat die skending van die beste-belang-beginsel nie geregverdig kan word in terme van artikel 36 van die Grondwet nie, aangesien daar geen bewys is dat die kriminalisering van sulke konsensuele seksuele gedrag adolessente daarvan sou weerhou om betrokke te raak nie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daarom het die Konstitusionele Hof die artikels 15 en 16 van die Wet ongeldig verklaar in die mate dat dit konsensuele seksuele gedrag tussen adolessente kriminaliseer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Die Konstitusionele Hof het die verklaring van ongeldigheid vir 18 maande opgeskort om die parlement toe te laat om die bepalings te wysig.

Tydens hierdie eerste been van die analise, waar na die rasionele verband tussen die bepaling en die doel daarvan gekyk word, het die Hof beklemtoon dat die private sekuriteitsbedryf &#39;n spesiale omgewing is en op die spel is die veiligheid en sekuriteit van die publiek in die algemeen. Artikel 12 van die Grondwet bied aan elkeen die reg op vryheid en veiligheid van die persoon, wat die reg insluit om van alle vorme van geweld uit of openbare of private bronne vry te wees. In &#39;n samelewing vol geweldsmisdaad, kan die belangrikheid van die beskerming van hierdie reg nie oordryf word nie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Die meerderheidsuitspraak het bevind dat die regulatoriese skema sorgvuldig ontwerp is met die doel om toetreders tot die private sekuriteitsbedryf te keur eerder as om &#39;n algemene verbod op die registrasie van vlugtelinge as privaat sekuriteitsdiensverskaffers daar te stel. Dit is nie te s&ecirc; dat buitelandse burgers, insluitend vlugtelinge, inherent minder betroubaar is as Suid-Afrikaners nie. In &#39;n land waar xenofobie verhoogde lyding veroorsaak het, is dit belangrik om dit te beklemtoon en te verduidelik dat dit nie is dat die Owerheid nie vlugtelinge vertrou nie. Die Sekuriteitswet is ontwerp om geskiktheid vir registrasie tot mense wie se betroubaarheid objektief geverifieer kon word te beperk, en dit is makliker om die betroubaarheid van burgers en permanente inwoners te verifieer. Die aanhef tot die Wet erken dat die reg op sekuriteit van die persoon fundamenteel is vir die welstand en tot die sosiale en ekonomiese ontwikkeling van elke persoon. Die Hof het dus bevind dat die onderskeid tussen burgers en permanente inwoners aan die een kant en ander buitelanders in hierdie geval rasioneel is en &#39;n wettige regeringsdoel dien.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By die vasstelling van differensiasie het die meerderheidsuitspraak dan oorweeg of die differensiasie op diskriminasie neerkom.

Die analise het toe gedraai of die diskriminasie onbillik is. Verskeie faktore is deur die Hof oorweeg oor die kwessie van billikheid, soos die feit dat terwyl vlugtelinge ten volle geregtig is om in Suid-Afrika te werk, artikel 22 van die Grondwet die reg om &#39;n werk te kies tot slegs burgers beperk. Die Hof was ook van mening dat vlugtelinge as sekuriteitsdiensverskaffers geregistreer kan word indien aan die vereistes van artikel 23(6) van die Veiligheidswet voldoen word en dat daar geen volledige uitsluiting van vlugtelinge van registrasie is nie.

Die andersdenkende regter het verklaar dat die bevel wat hy sou voorgestel het, was om te vereis dat vlugtelinge wat aan die ander vereistes van die Veiligheidswet kan voldoen, nie belet moet word om as sekuriteitsdiensverskaffers te registreer nie.

This Proclamation governed the setting-up of special African townships by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in areas under the African Native Trust. This Proclamation was one of the tools with which the apartheid state disposed Africans from landholding and created barriers to Africans owning any land. Instead, Africans could only hold rights to the lands through an insecure tenure system of Deeds of Grant and Certificates of Occupancy and letting for residential purposes. The township manager had the authority to cancel this tenure at any point. Special deeds registries were created to register the deeds of grant under the legislation.</p>\n<p>When South Africa transitioned to democratic majority rule, the President, empowered by the Interim Constitution, passed Proclamation R9 of 1997 together with amendments to the Deeds Registry Act. The impact of these changes was to regularise and create a more uniform approach to registration of titles in immovable property. The President also delegated certain legislative competencies to the provincial legislations to ensure multi-level governance.\u00a0<br>Consequently, the North West passed the North West Act 7 which supposedly repealed the whole of Proclamation R293.

Thus, <strong>section 8(2)</strong> imposes constitutional obligations on private entities, such as Pridwin.

The Court held that this is premised on the fact that <strong>section 29 of the Constitution</strong> places an obligation on all schools, both private and government schools, to not impair or interfere with the right to basic education. In this case, the school was unable to demonstrate appropriate reasons for limiting the rights of the applicants to basic education without providing an opportunity to the applicants to make representations to the school before the decision to remove the children from the school had been taken. The Court therefore held that the <strong>section 29</strong> right was impaired due to the absence of a fair procedure being followed prior to the termination of the contract. Accordingly, it was declared that that the school had the obligation to consider the rights of the applicants\u2019 children to have their views heard on the matter and to offer this opportunity to them.

To not have control over how some of the most traumatic and intimate moments of a child\u2019s life are shared with the public attacked the very core of the child\u2019s dignity.\n\n</p><p>The Court found that the right to dignity limited the reach of the right to freedom of expression, which is guaranteed by <b>section 16 of the Constitution</b> and includes <b>the right of the media to publish information</b>, and that the right to publish information could not to be used to justify the breach of the right to dignity.  The Court balanced freedom of expression and open justice on the one hand and the right to dignity and privacy on the other. The Court concluded that the serious harms caused to child participants, their dignity and privacy, outweigh the lesser negative effect of restricting open justice and the minimal interference in media freedom; this justified the granting of the default ongoing protection (anonymity for child victims). </p>\n\n<p>The Court held that the best interest of the child principle combined with the rights to dignity and privacy warrant ongoing protection for child participants into adulthood. The majority judgment states that there are different but warranted justifications for ongoing protection afforded to child victims, witnesses and accused. The Court acknowledged the open justice principle and the importance of freedom of expression, however held that the default position of offering the child participants ongoing protection did not result in a severe disadvantage on media freedom. The Court declared <b>section 154(3)</b> invalid and ordered an interim reading-in which specified that a person who is protected under the section does not forfeit the protections upon reaching adulthood, and is entitled to provide or withhold consent to the publication of their identity after reaching adulthood \u2013 or if consent is withheld, a competent court may be approached by the media to request the lifting of the publication ban.</p>\n\n<p>Cameron J, Froneman J and Jafta J agreed with the majority decision on the issue of victim protection but differed on question of ongoing protection. The dissenting judges agreed that under the section and in terms of the majority decision, up until the age of 18 children, including child victims, would be adequately protected. The minority judgments held that the right to freedom of expression and the principle of open justice tipped the scales in favour of a default regime in which anonymity protection ended when a protected child reaches 18 years of age, unless a court expressly extends the protection. The dissenting judgments argued further that the conclusion that the rights to dignity, privacy and the best interests of the child were infringed was hard to understand in the context of the ongoing protection. This was because the issue was that <b>section 154(3)</b> failed to protect children when they turn 18 years of age hence the fear that the media were going to publish the first applicant\u2019s identity when she turned 18.</p></div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The issue before the Court was that section 154(3) expressly provided anonymity protection for child accused or witnesses in criminal proceedings, however, the protection did not extend to child victims.

Citizenship related to the core of a person&rsquo;s identity, a sense of belonging in a community and to security of a person most especially in communities rife with xenophobia. Deprivation of, or interference with, a person&rsquo;s citizenship status affects their private and family life, their choices concerning where establish their homes, apply for jobs, enrol in schools; whether they can form part of the community; their ability to participate fully in the political activity and governance; and the extent to which they may exercise freedom of movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) The Constitutional Court held that whilst certain rights in the Constitution are only available to South African citizens, drawing arbitrary and irrational distinctions between citizens and non-citizens through legislation or decision-making is inconsistent with the Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iii) Legislation must be interpreted to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, but any interpretation must remain consistent with the text of the legislation.

The owner of the property (Blue Moonlight) approached the South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg seeking an order to evict the occupiers in order to develop the property. The occupiers opposed the eviction on the basis that it would almost certainly render them homeless and argued that the City of Johannesburg (the City) had an obligation to provide them with temporary housing under the Constitution and the <strong>Prevention of Illegal Eviction and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act, 19 of 1998 (PIE)</strong> before they could be evicted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The High Court granted the eviction order, but also ordered the City to remedy its housing policy as it was found to be unconstitutional and the High Court issued a structural interdict against the City obliging the City to report back to the High Court on the steps taken remedying its housing policy. The City was also ordered to provide temporary housing to the occupiers and to pay Blue Moonlight compensation until the eviction date. The City subsequently appealed the High Court&rsquo;s order to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). The SCA only set aside the structural interdict against the City and the High Court&rsquo;s compensation order and declared the City&rsquo;s housing policy unconstitutional to the extent that it excluded the occupiers from temporary housing and the City was ordered to provide them with &ldquo;temporary emergency accommodation&rdquo;. The City appealed the SCA&rsquo;s order to the Constitutional Court.</p>\r\n</div>", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2011/33/eng@2011-12-01", "id": "CityofJohannesburgMetropolitanMunicipalityvBlueMoonlightPropertiesPtyLtdandAnotherCCZACCBCLRCCSACC", "interpretation": "<div>\r\n<p>In a unanimous judgment by Van der Westhuizen J, the Court held that an owner&#39;s constitutional right not to be deprived of property must be interpreted in the social and historical context and be balanced against the right of access to adequate housing and not to be evicted arbitrarily from one&#39;s home. The Court emphasised that apartheid legislation undermined both the right of access to adequate housing and the right to property. Section 25 prohibits arbitrary deprivation of property, but also undertakes to redress unequal social conditions.</p>\r\nSection 26 of the Constitution &ldquo;highlights the transformative vision of the Constitution&rdquo; and PIE was enacted to specifically prevent the historical abuse of displacement of people. In this case, even though housing unlawful occupiers indefinitely suspends an owner&#39;s right to use and enjoy property, evictions can only be carried out in terms of PIE. PIE allows for the eviction of unlawful occupiers only in circumstances where such eviction is just and equitable.\r\n\r\n<p>In deciding whether an eviction is just and equitable in terms of PIE, the Court considered that many of the occupiers had lived on the property for a very long time, the occupation had once been lawful, Blue Moonlight was aware of the occupiers&rsquo; presence when it purchased the property, and the eviction of the occupiers would render them homeless while there was no competing risk of homelessness on the part of Blue Moonlight. Furthermore, the Court held that a key consideration was whether the City had made reasonable efforts to provide alternative accommodation to the occupiers. After considering the City&rsquo;s housing policy, the Court noted that the policy differentiated between persons relocated by the City itself and those evicted by private landowners. However, where relocation was sought by the City, these persons were housed in temporary accommodation, which was not the case with persons evicted by private landowners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court emphasised that section 26(2) of the Constitution recognises that the state is constrained by resources in giving effect to the right to adequate housing and therefore a housing policy may differentiate and give preference to categories of people; however any differentiation must be rational. The City&rsquo;s housing policy was found to be &ldquo;rigid&rdquo;. The Court held that the policy failed to take into account whether emergency accommodation should be made available in individual cases, considering the categories of persons affected (such as elderly people and children) and their circumstances, and that an imminent eviction might render them homeless, regardless of whether the eviction or relocation is sought by the City or a private landowner. The Court held that this differentiation was not rational. Where an eviction may result in homelessness, it is irrelevant whether such eviction is at the instance of the City or a private landowner. The Court emphasised that this matter concerns &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; accommodation in an emergency as defined in Chapter 12 of the National Housing Code and not &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; housing. The obligation, while derived from the right to progressive realisation of adequate housing in terms of <strong>section 26(2) of the Constitution</strong>, is distinct from the obligation to address permanent housing needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court therefore declared the City&rsquo;s housing policy unconstitutional and in violation of section 26 of the Constitution to the extent that it excluded people evicted by private landowners from its temporary housing programme. The Court dismissed the City&rsquo;s appeal and held that the occupiers had to vacate the properties by a given date. The Court stipulated that the City was to provide the evictees with &quot;temporary accommodation in a location as near as feasibly possible to the area&quot; in which the building was situated, in order to ensure that the occupiers were not rendered homeless between the date of eviction and the date by which the City would have to provide emergency housing.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation.

The City argued that local government does not have a primary role in fulfilling the right to access to adequate housing and that this mandate falls on the shoulders of the national and provincial government. The City argued that it fulfilled its duties after requesting assistance from provincial government and no more could be expected from it. The occupiers opposed the City&rsquo;s appeal and also applied for a conditional cross-appeal requesting that an order of eviction be linked to the condition that suitable alternative accommodation be provided and that the City report back on steps taken to remedying its housing policy.</p>", "snippet": "<p>The Court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation.</p>", "title": "City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality v Blue Moonlight Properties 39 (Pty) Ltd and Another (CC) [2011] ZACC 33; 2012 (2) BCLR 150 (CC); 2012 (2) SA 104 (CC)", "topics": ["sec_26__Housing"]}, {"date_updated": "2024-04-11T07:35:20.869277+00:00", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The Premier of Mpumalanga, acting under section 121 of the Constitution, referred the Mpumalanga Petitions Bill to the Constitutional Court so they could decide on the constitutionality of the Bill because he had two reservations about its constitutionality. </p>", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2001/10/eng@2001-10-05", "id": "ConstitutionalityoftheMpumalangaPetitionsBillZACCSACCBCLR", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court found that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the first issue because the Premier had not followed the process set out for him in <b>section 121 of the Constitution</b>.

The Court held that whether private persons will be bound by section 8(2) depends on a number of factors:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(i) What is the nature of the right? (Is the obligation positive or negative? That is, does the obligation require something to be done, or for the party to abstain from doing something?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) What is the history of the right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iii) What does the right seek to achieve?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iv) How best can that be chieved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(v) What is the &ldquo;potential of invasion of that right by persons other than the State or organs of State?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(vi) Would letting private persons off the net not negate the essential content of the right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madlanga J stressed that after weighing up these factors one concludes that private persons are bound and must bear a positive obligation, then such an obligation must be imposed and <strong>section 8(2)</strong> does envisage that such obligation can be imposed.

The decisive question is whether private persons should be bound by the right in the Bill of Rights. In relation to security of tenure, the duty (both positive and negative) imposed by the right to security of tenure does in fact rest on private persons. People in need of protection under ESTA often reside on land owned by private persons, as in this case. The obligation resting on an owner is a positive one. A private party is required by <strong>section 25(6) of the Constitution</strong> through ESTA to accommodate another on their land. The obligation is also negative in that the occupier&rsquo;s right should not be &ldquo;improperly invaded&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court held that Ms Daniels was entitled to make improvements to her dwelling and the parties were ordered to engage meaningfully regarding the implementation of the improvements.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<div>\r\n<p>The main question was whether the Extension of Security of Tenure Act afforded residents the right to make improvements to their dwelling without the owner&rsquo;s permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ESTA was promulgated under <strong>section 25(6) of the Constitution</strong> to afford security of tenure to persons who reside on land that they do not own.

The Court held that validity of legislation that gives the executive wide powers must be considered against the Constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers. By considering various foreign law approaches, the Court noted that Commonwealth countries had a clear separation of power when it came to the judiciary but that the separation between the legislature and executive is not as well defined.

The Court held that liquor licenses is a narrower construct than liquor trade and that national government has the competence to regulate the liquor trade in all respects other than liquor licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court explained that Schedule 4 competencies should be interpreted as being distinct from and excluding Schedule 5 competencies, but acknowledged that the separation of functional areas in Schedule 4 can never be absolute. Cameron J explained that where it is evident that the matter requires regulation inter-provincially (between provinces) as opposed to intra-provincially (within a single province), then the matter will fall within Schedule 4. Where provinces are given exclusive powers in Schedule 5, these apply to matters which can be regulated intra-provincially. Cameron J formulated the &ldquo;pith and substance&rdquo; test for determining legislative competence, which looks at whether the substance of the Bill falls within Schedule 4 or 5. That is, whether the substance requires inter or intra-provincial cooperation. The substance of the Bill depends on the purpose and effect of the Bill. All provisions which do not fall within the main substance of the Bill are treated as incidental and are disregarded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court was required to individually look at the three main areas of the Bill and determine whether the Bill fell within Schedule 4 or 5 for each area. It was held that the substance of the Bill was directed at three objectives. Firstly, the prohibition of cross-holdings between producers, distributors and retailers, and this was held to be an exclusive national competence. Secondly, the establishment of uniform conditions for national registration of manufacturers and distributors. Here it was held that provincial exclusive competence in relation to liquor licenses was not intended to cover the manufacturing and distribution of liquor because this was not an intra-provincial activity and was therefore an exclusive national competence. The third objective was to prescribe detailed mechanisms to provincial legislators for establishing retail licensing mechanisms. This was found to be an exclusive provincial competence under Schedule 5, which was liquor licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cameron J interpreted &ldquo;liquor licenses&rdquo; in Part A of Schedule 5 as referring to intra-provincial liquor licenses, but he found that even if exclusive provincial competence in respect of liquor licenses did extend to the manufacturing and distribution, national government&rsquo;s interest in maintaining economic unity would enable national government to intervene in terms of Section 44(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court concluded that the Liquor Bill was unconstitutional. In terms of Section 44(2), the national government was justified in intervening and creating a national system of registration for manufacturers and distributors and in prohibiting cross-holdings.

The first stage involves a consideration of the scope of the constitutional right and the scope of the challenged law in order to determine whether there has been an infringement. Accordingly, in this case, the Court analysed firstly whether section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act limited <strong>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong>, relating to the right to freedom and security of the person. The Court emphasised that a broad interpretation should be given to the right at this stage as the second stage of the limitation test involving <strong>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> prescribes the criteria that has to be met before an entrenched right can be justifiably limited. The Court held that section 417(2)(b) limited <strong>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> and then turned to the second stage of the limitation test. The second stage involved analysing whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable in a democratic society taking into account the prescribed factors in <strong>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong>. The Court emphasised in this matter that the onus is on the party relying on the legislation to justify the limitation in terms of <strong>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> and not for the party challenging it. On applying the second stage of the limitation test, the Court held that section 417(2)(b) unduly infringed on <strong>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong>.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Constitutional Court essentially had to determine the constitutionality of certain provisions of section 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973, relating to the examination of persons in the winding-up process of companies.

The Court held that: (i) there was no connection between the debt of the debtors and the owner of the property (FNB); (ii) there was no connection between the debt and the property (FNB\u2019s vehicles); (iii) the property owner (FNB) did not detriment SARS by placing the property (the vehicles) in the possession of the debtor hence there is no reason why the property owner should be subjected to interference or sanction.</p> \n\n<p>The Court therefore found section 114 of the Act unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed SARS to detain and sell seized property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.</p></div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The core of the Constitutional Court\u2019s analysis related to the question whether section 114 of the Act infringed section 25 of the Constitution which provides for the right to property by allowing SARS to seize property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.

The Court held that regardless of how reasonable or moderate parental chastisement is, it entails the use of force and some degree of violence.

Respondents stated that <strong>sections 26 and 28 of the Constitution of South Africa</strong> guaranteed the right of everyone to access to adequate housing and the right of children to be afforded special protection, and, in particular, shelter.

The Court held that the State had to create the conditions for access to adequate housing for people at all economic levels of society. The extent of the State&#39;s obligation was defined by three key elements, which had to be considered separately: the obligation to take reasonable legislative and other measures; to achieve the progressive realisation of section 26; and within available resources. For a person to have access to adequate housing, the Court held that there had to be the provision of land, services (such as the provision of water, the removal of sewage and the financing of all these) and a dwelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court further held that <strong>section 26</strong> placed an obligation on the State and all other entities and persons to desist from preventing or impairing the right of access to adequate housing.

A reasonable housing program, capable of facilitating the realisation of the right, had clearly required the State to allocate responsibilities and tasks to the different spheres of government and ensure that the appropriate financial and human resources were available to implement it. The formation of a program, however, was only the first stage in meeting the State&#39;s obligations. The program also had to be reasonably implemented, as failure to do so would not constitute compliance with the State&#39;s obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court found that &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; requires that a program implemented in order to realise a socio-economic right must be &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo;, &ldquo;coherent&rdquo;, &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; and &ldquo;flexible&rdquo;. More importantly, the Court insisted that a &ldquo;program that excludes a significant sector of society cannot be said to be reasonable&rdquo;. On this basis, The Court found the state housing program to be invalid to the extent that it failed to make provision for people in immediate and desperate need. The program, although laudable, concentrated unduly on the goal of constructing permanent houses for as many people as possible over time, instead of providing some form of shelter for the desperate in the interim. Therefore, the Court issued a declaratory order which required the State to design and implement a programme that included measures to provide relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the Constitutional Court declared that the government had not met its constitutional obligations and ordered the government, within its available resources, to devise, fund, implement and supervise measures to provide relief for all who are in desperate need.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Court considered whether the measures taken by the State to realise the right to access to housing afforded by <strong>section 26<strong> of the Constitution were reasonable, and whether the City of Cape Town&rsquo;s housing programmes met the obligations imposed on them by <strong>section 26</strong>.

Therefore, in order to succeed, the appellants would have to show that the administrative action in question negatively affected their rights or legitimate expectations. However, the found that the tenants had not proven that they had rights or legitimate expectations (legally recognisable interests) which were infringed by the administrative action (the Minister decision to grant the lease).

One of the founding values of our constitutional democracy is &ldquo;a multi-party system of democratic government, to ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness.&rdquo; This founding value must be given expression at the level of national, provincial and local government. Thus one of the objects of local government is &ldquo;to provide democratic and accountable government for local communities&rdquo;. The purpose of section 155(3)(b) is &ldquo;to guard against political interference in the process of creating new municipalities.&rdquo; For, if municipalities were to be established along party lines or if there was to be political interference in their establishment, this would undermine our multi-party system of democratic government. A deliberate decision was therefore made to confer the power to establish municipal areas upon an independent authority. In coming to this conclusion, the Court considered its judgment in Executive Council, Western Cape v Minister of Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development where it found that constitutional &ldquo;authority to determine municipal boundaries vests solely in the Demarcation Board.&rdquo; That authority extends to all categories of municipality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court found that the Municipal Demarcation Board was an independent authority vested with the power to draw municipal boundaries. In giving this board the power, the Constitution sought to prevent political interference in the process of creating municipal boundaries. However, this power was limited by the authority of Parliament to draw provincial boundaries. For the Court, it was inevitable that the alteration of provincial boundaries would impact on municipal boundaries. This was implicit in the power to alter provincial boundaries. Therefore, the Court found that the Twelfth Amendment did not violate <strong>the Constitution</strong> in interfering with municipal boundaries in the course of redrawing provincial boundaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With respect to the second issue, the Court raised doubt regarding whether the national legislative process for constitutional amendments was properly followed.

On this basis, the Court rejected the suggestion that the learner could attend another school as the Constitution requires for difference to be reasonably accommodated and celebrated. The Court ruled that the constitutional rights and protections namely, under <strong>sections 15 and 31</strong> applied equally to both compulsory and voluntary (non-compulsory) practices of culture and religion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court noted that the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of religion or culture under <strong>section 9 of the Constitution</strong> is different from the protection of religion in <strong>section 15</strong> and culture in <strong>sections 30 and 31</strong> under the separate constitutional rights, even if there is overlap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court observed that: (i) religion generally relates to personal faith and belief; (ii) culture relates to traditions and beliefs developed by a community; (iii) there is an overlap between the two as religious practices are often influenced by faith and custom, while cultural beliefs are often built on a community&rsquo;s underlying religious or spiritual beliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is interesting to note that, in her partial dissent, O&rsquo;Regan J had the following to say in relation to the right to religion and culture: She contends that although it is not easy to divine a sharp dividing line between the two, it does seem to me that our Constitution recognises that culture is not the same as religion, and should not always be treated as if it is. Religion is dealt with without mention of culture in <strong>section 15</strong>, which entrenches the right to freedom of belief and conscience. By associating religion with belief and conscience, which involve an individual&rsquo;s state of mind, religion is understood in an individualist sense: a set of beliefs that an individual may hold regardless of the beliefs of others. The exclusion of culture from <strong>section 15</strong> suggests that culture is different. The inclusion of culture in <strong>section 30</strong> and <strong>section 31</strong> makes it clear that by and large culture as conceived in our Constitution, involves associative practices and not individual beliefs. So, <strong>section 31</strong> speaks of the right of persons who are members of religious, linguistic or cultural communities &ldquo;with other members of that community&rdquo; to enjoy their culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, religion, according to O&rsquo;Regan J, need not be associative at all. A religious belief can be entirely personal. The importance of a personal religious belief is more often than not based on a particular relationship with a deity or deities that may have little bearing on community or associative practices. Where one is dealing with personal and individualised belief, religion is to be considered differently to culture, as the Constitution makes clear. In such circumstances, it is appropriate for a court to ask whether the belief is sincerely held in order to decide whether a litigant has established that it falls within the scope of section 15. If a sincere religious belief is established, it seems correct that a court will not investigate the belief further as the cases cited by the Chief Justice in his judgment make plain. A religious belief is personal, and need not be rational, nor need it be shared by others. A court must simply be persuaded that it is a profound and sincerely held belief.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Constitutional Court had to determine whether the school infringed the learner&rsquo;s cultural and religious rights under <strong>sections 9 and 31 of the Constitution</strong> through the application of its Code of Conduct.

The Court recognised that almost all the parties were in agreement that <strong>section 118(1)</strong> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> and <strong>section 50(1)(a)</strong> of the <em>Ordinance</em> brought about deprivation of property. The Court dismissed the argument that these provisions were only regulatory in nature and held that a <strong>&ldquo;substantial interference&rdquo;</strong> with the enjoyment or use of property that goes beyond the normal restrictions would amount to deprivation. The deprivation here was that owners were unable to transfer their properties unless consumption charges due by people other than themselves and for which they were not liable had been paid. The Court then turned to whether this deprivation was arbitrary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court held that there must be <strong>&ldquo;sufficient reason&rdquo;</strong> for the deprivation or else it would be arbitrary, and the greater the deprivation the more compelling the reason for such deprivation must be. The Court reasoned that the requirement served the important purpose of encouraging payment and considering the various categories of occupiers, the owner is usually in a position to take reasonable steps to prevent the unreasonable accumulation of outstanding consumption charges. It was therefore reasonable for the owner to bear this risk. Even in the case of unlawful occupiers, the owner is in the position to take reasonable steps to ensure it is not unlawfully occupied, by securing the property and instituting eviction proceedings to ensure such occupiers do not remain on the property for long. The deprivation in question related to one element of ownership (the right to alienate property). The Court emphasised that this was not an insubstantial deprivation as the provision requires the owner of the property to bear the risk of non-payment of consumption charges by non-owner occupiers. The Court stated that the relationship between the owner, the property and the consumption charge was sufficiently close to require the owner to bear the risk of non-payment and <strong>section 118(1)</strong> was not found to be arbitrary, Similarly, in cases of unlawful occupation the burden placed on the owner was held not to render <strong>section 118(1)</strong> arbitrary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court also held that that procedural fairness necessitates that all municipalities must, on the written request of owners, provide owners with copies of electricity and water accounts sent to occupiers.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>One of the core issues the Constitutional Court had to determine was whether <strong>section 118(1)</strong> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> and <strong>section 50(1)(a)</strong> of the <em>Ordinance</em> were consistent with <strong>section 25 of the Constitution</strong>.

One of the defences raised by the applicants during the trial was the constitutional validity of section 12(1)(a) of the Act and the Magistrates&rsquo; Court granted the applicants leave to appeal to the High Court to challenge the constitutionality of this provision. The High Court found section 12(1)(a) of the Act had a &ldquo;chilling&rdquo; and deterring effect on section 17 of the Constitution and unjustifiably limited the right.

The Court states that the right to privacy covers the right to live life as one pleases.

The respondents argued that the applicants&rsquo; names had been disclosed in the Straus Report, and as the report was not marked &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;, their HIV status was not a private fact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court emphasised that information about person&rsquo;s health is highly sensitive and personal in nature and raises an expectation that a person&rsquo;s right to privacy in relation to this information will not be interfered with. The Court highlighted that an individual&rsquo;s HIV status deserves protection against unwarranted disclosure due to the negative social connotations associated with the disease and potential discrimination. Parties must balance the need for access to information against the right to privacy in all cases and not only when other fundamental rights are at play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court held that there must be a compelling social need for this expectation of privacy to be violated. No public interest justified the violation of the applicants&rsquo; right to privacy in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court also held that the respondents did not establish if the applicants had given consent despite having time to do so, and they could have used pseudonyms which would not have taken away from the book&#39;s authenticity.

The occupiers then appealed the High Court&rsquo;s order to the SCA.

One of the provisions of the Bill of Rights that has to be interpreted with these values in mind, is <strong>section 25</strong>, which provides the right to property. This matter accordingly turned on determining the constitutional relationship between <strong>section 25</strong> and <strong>section 26</strong>. Sections 25 and 26 create an overlap between land rights and socio-economic rights and it is the duty of the state to fulfil both rights. The court held that the provisions of <strong>section 25, subsections 4-9</strong> must be borne in mind whenever <strong>section 25</strong> was being construed; this is because under the Constitution, the protection of property as an individual right was not absolute but subject to societal considerations. The Court also held that the state has a duty to satisfy both property and housing rights provided for in <strong>sections 25 and 26 of the Constitution and must seek to balance these rights</strong> Section 26(3) of the Constitution demonstrates special constitutional consideration for a person&rsquo;s home and acknowledges that a home is more than just a shelter from the elements, but is also an area of personal intimacy and family security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court furthermore held that the <em>Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act 19 of 1998 (PIE)</em> cannot simply be looked at as a legislative mechanism to re-establish common law property rights.

Under PIE squatting was decriminalised and evictions were subject to requirements in line with the Bill of Rights. The provisions of PIE must be considered against the values of South Africa&rsquo;s new constitutional dispensation. In making its decision, the court must consider all relevant circumstances, including the manner in which occupation was effected, its duration and the availability of suitable alternative accommodation or land, the motivation for settling on land, the degree of desperation of people who have sought land, and whether people occupied land with a plausible belief that they have permission to be there (as opposed to those who deliberately invade land to deliberately disrupt the organised housing programme and place themselves at the front of the queue). Regarding suitable alternative accommodation, the Court emphasised that this will vary from municipality to municipality and depends on the number of people facing eviction in each case and whether the municipality is able to secure suitable accommodation for unlawful occupiers without prejudicing the claims of lawful occupiers and those in line for formal housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court held that considering the period which the occupiers have lived on the land, the fact that eviction is not necessary for the land to be used productively and that this is a relatively small group of people who appear to be genuinely homeless and in need, it would not be just and equitable to order the eviction.

The Court found that the powers afforded to the applicant were executive in nature and as such subject to be reviewed by a court of law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Court found that that section 82(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> contained non-statutory powers which included the power to grant pardons. These powers did not derive their authority from any legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These powers were not legislative or judicial. Therefore, they are executive in nature as there is no fourth branch of government. This was supported by <strong>section 83</strong> of the Interim Constitution which refers to section 82 powers as &ldquo;executive acts&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, when the President exercises constitutional powers in terms of section 82(1) of the Interim Constitution, he acts as an executive organ of government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since all organs of state are subject to the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, all exercises of presidential power are subject to the provisions of the Interim Constitution, which include the Bill of Rights. Therefore, the President&rsquo;s exercise of constitutionally derived powers can be reviewed by courts of law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court found that the powers afforded to the President under <strong>section 82</strong> could be exercised without the approval of the Cabinet but the President needed to consult with the Executive Deputy Presidents (as per section 82(1) of the Interim Constitution) before exercising this power. The President was not however bound by their views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court added that the section 82(1) of the Interim Constitution placed specific matters within the power of the President. It emphasised that this did not mean that if a President were to abuse this power vested in him or her under section 82(1)(k) a court would be powerless, for it was implicit in the Interim Constitution that the President will exercise that power in good faith. If, for instance, a President were to abuse his or her powers by acting in bad faith the Court saw no reason why a court should not intervene to correct such action and to declare it to be unconstitutional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Respondent sought to review the exercise of the President&rsquo;s power on the basis that it violated the Bill of Rights by unfairly discriminating against him on the basis of sex or gender. The Court held that the pardoning of certain mothers with children under the age of 12 targeted a particular group of prisoners and was therefore discriminatory on the combined basis of sex and parenthood of children below the age of 12. A finding that discrimination occurred is not the end of the inquiry as the Interim Constitution only prohibits discrimaintion that is unfair. To determine whether the discrimination was unfair the Court looked at the impact of the discrimination. According to the Court, the impact on fathers of young children who were not released was found not to significantly compromise the dignity and worth of the men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the pardon did not discriminate unfairly because the discretion to pardon was with the applicant and the pardon did not prevent fathers from directly applying to the applicant to be pardoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court concluded that the President had exercised his discretion fairly and in a manner that was consistent with the Interim Constitution.

Due to the nature of his illness, the appellant was denied treatment and he applied to the Durban High Court for an order directing Addington Hospital to provide him with ongoing dialysis and treatment and interdicting the hospital from refusing him admission to the renal unit.

The appellant had a chronic and irreversible medical condition and needed renal dialysis two to three times a week and this did not constitute an emergency in terms of <strong>section 27(3) of the Constitution</strong>.

The Court affirmed that the rights that individuals enjoy in terms of section 27 of the Constitution are dependent upon the resources available for such purposes, and that the corresponding rights themselves are limited by the lack of resources. The Court found that the provincial health department&rsquo;s resources were already severely strained and that if the Court were to decide that treatment had to be provided to Mr Soobramoney it would also have to be provided to all others in a similar position and the resources available to the hospital could not accommodate the demand.

The Court concluded that it had not been shown that the state&rsquo;s failure to provide renal dialysis facilities for all persons suffering from chronic renal failure constitutes a breach of its constitutional obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the Court found that the government hospital&rsquo;s refusal to provide him with dialysis did not violate section 27(1) of the nor section 27(3) of the Constitution.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Constitutional Court had to decide Mr Soobramoney had a right to receive ongoing renal dialysis from a state hospital in terms of <strong>section 27</strong>, which provides everyone with the right to access healthcare services, and <strong>section 27(3) of the Constitution</strong> which provides that <strong>&ldquo;No one may be refused emergency medical treatment&rdquo;</strong>.

The applicants&rsquo; argued that it was not rational for a convener of a gathering to take all reasonable steps to prevent an act or omission even if that act or omission was not reasonably foreseeable. Mogoeng CJ, considered the meaning of the provision and held that there is a connection between the steps that a convener takes, within its power, and preventing harm that is reasonably foreseeable. If appropriate steps are adopted when planning a gathering and these steps are reasonable to prevent foreseeable outcomes, the taking of such steps would render any act or omission that resulted in riot damage to be classified as reasonably unforeseeable. The defence was therefore found to be rational.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mogoeng CJ, then turned to considered whether the provision limited section 17 of the Constitution. Mogoeng J held that section 11(2) of the Regulation of Gatherings Act does limit section 17 of the Constitution as it requires conveners of gatherings to adhere to the requirements and can potentially increase the cost of organising a protest which could bar under-resourced organisations from being able to protest. The question was whether this limitation could be justified in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution as a reasonable and justifiable limitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On conducting the limitation analysis in terms of section 36 of the Constitution, and looking at the importance of the right to assemble, the Court emphasised that the right to freedom of assembly is central to our constitutional democracy. It exists to give a voice to less powerful people in society and groups that do not wield political or economic power and other vulnerable persons. The right may be the only mechanism for such persons to express their concerns. Bearing in mind the significance of this right, the purpose of the limitation must be important enough to justify the limitation. The Court held that the purpose of the limitation, to protect individuals, especially those who themselves are under-resourced, who suffer damages caused by protests, is a crucial one. The Court reasoned that the public has no means to control protests whereas organisers are in a position to control and manage protests. Organizations have a choice between exercising the right to assemble or abandoning protests in order to prevent reasonably foreseeable damage. Conversely, victims of riot damage have no choice regarding what may happen to them or their property. Therefore, the Court held that the justification provided for by the law was viable and that the limitation on the right to freedom of assembly in <strong>section 17 of the Constitution</strong> was held to be reasonable and justifiable. The Court emphasized that the Regulation of Gatherings Act does not nullify the right to freedom of assembly, but imposes strict conditions on the right in order to prevent injury to persons or property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a concurring judgment, Jafta J held that the appeal should be dismissed, on the basis that the applicants had failed to prove that section 11(2) of the Regulations of Gatherings Act limited the right to freedom of assembly.

As a matter of logic what is bad for all children will be bad for one child in a particular case.

Legislation would be inconsistent with this right if it is demonstrated to be against the interests of children in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court found that sections 15 and 16 of the Act were unconstitutional in that they infringed the rights of adolescents (12- to 16-year olds) to dignity and privacy, and further in that they violated the best-interests principle contained in <strong>section 28(2) of the Constitution</strong>. The Court held that the sections infringed the best-interests principle in many ways. Most importantly, the offences created by the provisions ran the risk of exposing children to the harmful effects of the criminal justice system and could undermine support structures by deterring adolescents from seeking help and could create a breakdown in parental care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relying on expert evidence, the Court concluded that the provisions criminalized what constituted developmentally normal conduct for adolescents, and adversely affected the very children the Act sought to protect. The effects of the provisions were found not to be rationally related to the State&rsquo;s purpose of protecting children. The Court then found that the infringement of the best-interests principle cannot be justified in terms of section 36 of the Constitution as was no evidence that criminalising such consensual sexual behaviour would deter adolescents from engaging in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the Constitutional Court declared the sections 15 and 16 of the Act invalid to the extent that they criminalized consensual sexual conduct between adolescents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Constitutional Court suspended the declaration of invalidity for 18 months to allow Parliament to amend the provisions. The Court further ordered a suspension on all investigations, arrests, prosecutions and criminal and ancillary proceedings (regarding adolescents) in relation to sections 15 and 16 of the Act, until Parliament remedied the defects identified. Finally, the Minister was ordered to take the necessary steps to ensure that the details of any adolescent convicted of an offence in terms of sections 15 or 16 of the Act will not appear in the National Register for Sex Offenders and that such an adolescent will have his or her criminal record removed.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The applicants argued at the Constitutional Court that sections 15 and 16 of the Act unjustifiably infringe children&rsquo;s constitutional rights to dignity, privacy and bodily and psychological integrity, as well as the principle in section 28(2) of the Constitution that a child&#39;s best interests must be of paramount importance in all matters concerning the child.

Kondile AJ, writing for the majority, started the equality analysis by firstly considering, whether the provision differentiated between categories of people and if there was such differentiation whether there was a legitimate rationale for such differentiation. During this first leg of the analysis, looking at the rational connection between the provision and its purpose, the Court emphasised that the private security industry was a special environment and at stake was the safety and security of the public at large. <strong>Section 12 of the Constitution</strong> provides everyone with the right to freedom and security of the person, which includes the right to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources. In a society rife with violent crime, the importance of protecting this right could not be exaggerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority judgment held that the regulatory scheme was carefully designed for the purpose of screening entrants to the private security industry rather than constituting a blanket ban on the registration of refugees as private security service providers. That is not to say that foreign nationals, including refugees, are inherently less trustworthy than South Africans. In a country where xenophobia has caused increased suffering, it was important to stress this and explain that it was not that the Authority did not trust refugees. The Security Act was designed to limit eligibility for registration to people whose trustworthiness could be objectively verified, and it was easier to verify the trustworthiness of citizens and permanent residents. The preamble to the Act acknowledges that the right to security of the person is fundamental to the well-being and to the social and economic development of every person. The Court therefore held that the differentiation between citizens and permanent residents on one hand and other foreigners in this instance, was rational and served a legitimate government purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On establishing differentiation, the majority judgment then considered whether the differentiation amounted to discrimination. The Court held that in this instance, the differentiation was on grounds analogous to those listed in section 9(3) of the Constitution, and therefore constituted discrimination. The analysis then turned to whether the discrimination was unfair. Various factors were considered by the Court on the question of fairness, such as the fact that while refugees were fully entitled to work in South Africa, <strong>section 22 of the Constitution</strong> limited the right to choose a job to citizens only. The Court also considered that refugees could be registered as security service providers if the requirements of section 23(6) of the Security Act were met and that there was no complete exclusion of refugees from being registered. The majority found that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act did not unfairly discriminate against the applicants and was therefore constitutionally sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their dissenting judgment, Mokgoro J and O&#39;Regan J held that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act discriminated unfairly on the basis of refugee status. The joint dissenting judgment was not convinced that the purpose identified by the Minister to ensure that security service employees were trustworthy was really intended by the section. The dissenting judgment stated that the order it would have proposed was to require that refugees who could meet the other requirements of the Security Act should not be barred from registration as security service providers. Those refugees who could not meet those requirements should seek to establish that &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; exists for them to be registered as contemplated by section 23(6) of the Security Act.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<div>\r\n<p>The applicants applied to the High Court to review and set aside the decisions of the Authority and the Appeal Committee and in the alternative they sought to declare section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act inconsistent with the Constitution on the basis that it violated the right to equality in section 9 of the Constitution as it unfairly discriminated against the applicants due to their refugee status.

This Proclamation was one of the tools with which the apartheid state disposed Africans from landholding and created barriers to Africans owning any land. Instead, Africans could only hold rights to the lands through an insecure tenure system of Deeds of Grant and Certificates of Occupancy and letting for residential purposes. The township manager had the authority to cancel this tenure at any point. Special deeds registries were created to register the deeds of grant under the legislation.</p>\n<p>When South Africa transitioned to democratic majority rule, the President, empowered by the Interim Constitution, passed Proclamation R9 of 1997 together with amendments to the Deeds Registry Act. The impact of these changes was to regularise and create a more uniform approach to registration of titles in immovable property. The President also delegated certain legislative competencies to the provincial legislations to ensure multi-level governance.\u00a0<br>Consequently, the North West passed the North West Act 7 which supposedly repealed the whole of Proclamation R293. Similar to other provincial governments, it considered the Proclamation to be unconstitutional.\u00a0</p>\n<p>DVB Behuising (Pty) Ltd was aggrieved by the North West\u2019s decision and applied to the High Court for an order upholding the constitutionality of the provision. It also argued that the repeal had a negative impact on its property business since its clients were left with an insecure form of land tenure. This order was granted at the High Court, and was the subject of the current appeal.</p></div>", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2000/2/eng@2000-03-02", "id": "WesternCapeProvincialGovernmentandOthers;InRe:DVBBehuising(Pty)LimitedvNorthWestProvincialGovernmentandAnother(CCT22/99)[2000]ZACC2", "interpretation": "<p>The action by the North West Government to revoke regulations 1 and 3 of Proclamation R293 was of no force or consequence.

This could create an anomaly as persons who acquired citizenship by descent under the previous version of the Citizenship Act would now be excluded. This apparent exclusion could be resolved by adopting a purposive interpretation of section 2(1)(b).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court interpreted the term &lsquo;is born&rsquo; in section 2(1)(b) as a &ldquo;state of being&rdquo; not indicative of a tense, but rather including all persons regardless of when they were born. The Court held that this was a reasonable and constitutionally compliant interpretation which meant that section 2 was applicable to persons born to a South African parent before and after 1 January 2013, curing the anomaly.</p>\r\nThis interpretation allowed for all categories of citizens who acquired citizenship by birth or descent in terms of the previous version of the Citizenship Act to be included. As the 2010 Amendment could be interpreted in a constitutionally compliant manner, the findings of invalidity in the High Court were not confirmed by the Constitutional Court.\r\n\r\n<p>The Constitutional Court thereby ensured that the sections of the 2010 Amendment would be interpreted and applied consistently with <strong>section 20 of the Constitution</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(i) On section 20 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court held that although the importance of citizenship should not be overemphasised, citizenship is a gateway right to many other constitutional rights &ndash; namely, freedom of movement, freedom of trade and political rights, and is more than a legal status. Citizenship related to the core of a person&rsquo;s identity, a sense of belonging in a community and to security of a person most especially in communities rife with xenophobia. Deprivation of, or interference with, a person&rsquo;s citizenship status affects their private and family life, their choices concerning where establish their homes, apply for jobs, enrol in schools; whether they can form part of the community; their ability to participate fully in the political activity and governance; and the extent to which they may exercise freedom of movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) The Constitutional Court held that whilst certain rights in the Constitution are only available to South African citizens, drawing arbitrary and irrational distinctions between citizens and non-citizens through legislation or decision-making is inconsistent with the Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iii) Legislation must be interpreted to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, but any interpretation must remain consistent with the text of the legislation. The Constitutional Court interpreted <strong>section 2(1) of the 2010 Amendment</strong> by analysing the plain meaning of the words, the context of the case and section&rsquo;s purpose in light of the Bill of Rights. The Constitutional Court adopted an interpretation that was consistent with and promoted both the text of the section (by recognising that the section&rsquo;s language is not time-specific but rather linked to a condition of having been born) as well as the Bill of Rights (not to arbitrarily deprive persons of their citizenship overnight, as required by section 20 linked to other constitutional rights).</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<div>\r\n<p>Based on the Respondents&rsquo; interpretation of the 2010 Amendment, the applicants were unable to gain citizenship, despite having the right to gain citizenship under the previous version of the Citizenship Act had they registered their births.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Section 20 of the Constitution provides that: &lsquo;No citizen may be deprived of citizenship&#39;.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue before the Constitutional Court was whether it was possible to interpret section 2(1) of the 2010 Amendment in a manner constitutionally complaint with section 20 of the Constitution.

The owner of the property (Blue Moonlight) approached the South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg seeking an order to evict the occupiers in order to develop the property. The occupiers opposed the eviction on the basis that it would almost certainly render them homeless and argued that the City of Johannesburg (the City) had an obligation to provide them with temporary housing under the Constitution and the <strong>Prevention of Illegal Eviction and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act, 19 of 1998 (PIE)</strong> before they could be evicted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The High Court granted the eviction order, but also ordered the City to remedy its housing policy as it was found to be unconstitutional and the High Court issued a structural interdict against the City obliging the City to report back to the High Court on the steps taken remedying its housing policy. The City was also ordered to provide temporary housing to the occupiers and to pay Blue Moonlight compensation until the eviction date. The City subsequently appealed the High Court&rsquo;s order to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). The SCA only set aside the structural interdict against the City and the High Court&rsquo;s compensation order and declared the City&rsquo;s housing policy unconstitutional to the extent that it excluded the occupiers from temporary housing and the City was ordered to provide them with &ldquo;temporary emergency accommodation&rdquo;.

The Court emphasised that apartheid legislation undermined both the right of access to adequate housing and the right to property. Section 25 prohibits arbitrary deprivation of property, but also undertakes to redress unequal social conditions.</p>\r\nSection 26 of the Constitution &ldquo;highlights the transformative vision of the Constitution&rdquo; and PIE was enacted to specifically prevent the historical abuse of displacement of people. In this case, even though housing unlawful occupiers indefinitely suspends an owner&#39;s right to use and enjoy property, evictions can only be carried out in terms of PIE. PIE allows for the eviction of unlawful occupiers only in circumstances where such eviction is just and equitable.\r\n\r\n<p>In deciding whether an eviction is just and equitable in terms of PIE, the Court considered that many of the occupiers had lived on the property for a very long time, the occupation had once been lawful, Blue Moonlight was aware of the occupiers&rsquo; presence when it purchased the property, and the eviction of the occupiers would render them homeless while there was no competing risk of homelessness on the part of Blue Moonlight. Furthermore, the Court held that a key consideration was whether the City had made reasonable efforts to provide alternative accommodation to the occupiers. After considering the City&rsquo;s housing policy, the Court noted that the policy differentiated between persons relocated by the City itself and those evicted by private landowners. However, where relocation was sought by the City, these persons were housed in temporary accommodation, which was not the case with persons evicted by private landowners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court emphasised that section 26(2) of the Constitution recognises that the state is constrained by resources in giving effect to the right to adequate housing and therefore a housing policy may differentiate and give preference to categories of people; however any differentiation must be rational. The City&rsquo;s housing policy was found to be &ldquo;rigid&rdquo;. The Court held that the policy failed to take into account whether emergency accommodation should be made available in individual cases, considering the categories of persons affected (such as elderly people and children) and their circumstances, and that an imminent eviction might render them homeless, regardless of whether the eviction or relocation is sought by the City or a private landowner. The Court held that this differentiation was not rational. Where an eviction may result in homelessness, it is irrelevant whether such eviction is at the instance of the City or a private landowner. The Court emphasised that this matter concerns &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; accommodation in an emergency as defined in Chapter 12 of the National Housing Code and not &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; housing. The obligation, while derived from the right to progressive realisation of adequate housing in terms of <strong>section 26(2) of the Constitution</strong>, is distinct from the obligation to address permanent housing needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court therefore declared the City&rsquo;s housing policy unconstitutional and in violation of section 26 of the Constitution to the extent that it excluded people evicted by private landowners from its temporary housing programme. The Court dismissed the City&rsquo;s appeal and held that the occupiers had to vacate the properties by a given date. The Court stipulated that the City was to provide the evictees with &quot;temporary accommodation in a location as near as feasibly possible to the area&quot; in which the building was situated, in order to ensure that the occupiers were not rendered homeless between the date of eviction and the date by which the City would have to provide emergency housing.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation.

The City argued that local government does not have a primary role in fulfilling the right to access to adequate housing and that this mandate falls on the shoulders of the national and provincial government. The City argued that it fulfilled its duties after requesting assistance from provincial government and no more could be expected from it. The occupiers opposed the City&rsquo;s appeal and also applied for a conditional cross-appeal requesting that an order of eviction be linked to the condition that suitable alternative accommodation be provided and that the City report back on steps taken to remedying its housing policy.</p>", "snippet": "<p>The Court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation.</p>", "title": "City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality v Blue Moonlight Properties 39 (Pty) Ltd and Another (CC) [2011] ZACC 33; 2012 (2) BCLR 150 (CC); 2012 (2) SA 104 (CC)", "topics": ["sec_26__Housing"]}, {"date_updated": "2024-04-11T07:35:20.869277+00:00", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The Premier of Mpumalanga, acting under section 121 of the Constitution, referred the Mpumalanga Petitions Bill to the Constitutional Court so they could decide on the constitutionality of the Bill because he had two reservations about its constitutionality. </p>", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2001/10/eng@2001-10-05", "id": "ConstitutionalityoftheMpumalangaPetitionsBillZACCSACCBCLR", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court found that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the first issue because the Premier had not followed the process set out for him in <b>section 121 of the Constitution</b>.

The Court held that whether private persons will be bound by section 8(2) depends on a number of factors:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(i) What is the nature of the right? (Is the obligation positive or negative? That is, does the obligation require something to be done, or for the party to abstain from doing something?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) What is the history of the right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iii) What does the right seek to achieve?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iv) How best can that be chieved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(v) What is the &ldquo;potential of invasion of that right by persons other than the State or organs of State?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(vi) Would letting private persons off the net not negate the essential content of the right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madlanga J stressed that after weighing up these factors one concludes that private persons are bound and must bear a positive obligation, then such an obligation must be imposed and <strong>section 8(2)</strong> does envisage that such obligation can be imposed.

The decisive question is whether private persons should be bound by the right in the Bill of Rights. In relation to security of tenure, the duty (both positive and negative) imposed by the right to security of tenure does in fact rest on private persons. People in need of protection under ESTA often reside on land owned by private persons, as in this case. The obligation resting on an owner is a positive one. A private party is required by <strong>section 25(6) of the Constitution</strong> through ESTA to accommodate another on their land. The obligation is also negative in that the occupier&rsquo;s right should not be &ldquo;improperly invaded&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court held that Ms Daniels was entitled to make improvements to her dwelling and the parties were ordered to engage meaningfully regarding the implementation of the improvements.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<div>\r\n<p>The main question was whether the Extension of Security of Tenure Act afforded residents the right to make improvements to their dwelling without the owner&rsquo;s permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ESTA was promulgated under <strong>section 25(6) of the Constitution</strong> to afford security of tenure to persons who reside on land that they do not own.

The Court held that liquor licenses is a narrower construct than liquor trade and that national government has the competence to regulate the liquor trade in all respects other than liquor licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court explained that Schedule 4 competencies should be interpreted as being distinct from and excluding Schedule 5 competencies, but acknowledged that the separation of functional areas in Schedule 4 can never be absolute. Cameron J explained that where it is evident that the matter requires regulation inter-provincially (between provinces) as opposed to intra-provincially (within a single province), then the matter will fall within Schedule 4. Where provinces are given exclusive powers in Schedule 5, these apply to matters which can be regulated intra-provincially. Cameron J formulated the &ldquo;pith and substance&rdquo; test for determining legislative competence, which looks at whether the substance of the Bill falls within Schedule 4 or 5. That is, whether the substance requires inter or intra-provincial cooperation. The substance of the Bill depends on the purpose and effect of the Bill. All provisions which do not fall within the main substance of the Bill are treated as incidental and are disregarded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court was required to individually look at the three main areas of the Bill and determine whether the Bill fell within Schedule 4 or 5 for each area. It was held that the substance of the Bill was directed at three objectives. Firstly, the prohibition of cross-holdings between producers, distributors and retailers, and this was held to be an exclusive national competence. Secondly, the establishment of uniform conditions for national registration of manufacturers and distributors. Here it was held that provincial exclusive competence in relation to liquor licenses was not intended to cover the manufacturing and distribution of liquor because this was not an intra-provincial activity and was therefore an exclusive national competence. The third objective was to prescribe detailed mechanisms to provincial legislators for establishing retail licensing mechanisms. This was found to be an exclusive provincial competence under Schedule 5, which was liquor licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cameron J interpreted &ldquo;liquor licenses&rdquo; in Part A of Schedule 5 as referring to intra-provincial liquor licenses, but he found that even if exclusive provincial competence in respect of liquor licenses did extend to the manufacturing and distribution, national government&rsquo;s interest in maintaining economic unity would enable national government to intervene in terms of Section 44(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court concluded that the Liquor Bill was unconstitutional. In terms of Section 44(2), the national government was justified in intervening and creating a national system of registration for manufacturers and distributors and in prohibiting cross-holdings.

The section 25(3) rights only apply to an &ldquo;accused person&rdquo; in a criminal trial. The threat only arises once a person who tendered evidence in a section 417 inquiry is accused in a criminal trial and that evidence tendered is specifically used. Therefore, section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act was not held to constitute an infringement on any section 25(3) rights and the majority dismissed this challenge. The Court then considered the alternative main argument that section 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 infringed sections 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution. The Court held that the analysis contains two stages. One first has to determine whether there was an infringement of sections 11 and 13 of the Constitution. If there was an infringement then one has to analyse whether this infringement may be justified under <strong>s 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> (the limitation clause &ndash; now <strong>section 36 of the Constitution</strong>). On this analysis, the Court held that section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act unduly infringed on section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution and declared it invalid only to the extent that answers given at such an inquiry may be used against such a person in criminal proceedings against the person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that this matter was heard in terms of the Interim Constitution. <strong>Section 36 of the Constitution</strong> (the limitation of rights provision) is the replacement to section 33 of the Interim Constitution. This judgment confirmed that the limitation of rights exercise concerns two stages. The first stage involves a consideration of the scope of the constitutional right and the scope of the challenged law in order to determine whether there has been an infringement. Accordingly, in this case, the Court analysed firstly whether section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act limited <strong>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong>, relating to the right to freedom and security of the person. The Court emphasised that a broad interpretation should be given to the right at this stage as the second stage of the limitation test involving <strong>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> prescribes the criteria that has to be met before an entrenched right can be justifiably limited. The Court held that section 417(2)(b) limited <strong>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> and then turned to the second stage of the limitation test. The second stage involved analysing whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable in a democratic society taking into account the prescribed factors in <strong>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong>. The Court emphasised in this matter that the onus is on the party relying on the legislation to justify the limitation in terms of <strong>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> and not for the party challenging it.

The Court also gave a list of factors to be taken into account to determine whether there is \u2018sufficient reason\u2019, such as the nature and complexity of the relationship between the means and ends; and the nature or type of the right or property in question (i.e. ownership in land or other extensive property rights will require more justification in order to be sufficient).</p>\n\n<p>Following this analysis, the Court held that section 114 of the Act deprived FNB permanently of all its rights and benefits as owner of the vehicles. On applying the test for whether the deprivation was arbitrary or not, and therefore whether the deprivation was constitutional or not, the Court concluded that the deprivation, the seizure by SARS under section 114 of FNB\u2019s vehicles, was arbitrary and unconstitutional because there was insufficient reason justifying it. The Court held that: (i) there was no connection between the debt of the debtors and the owner of the property (FNB); (ii) there was no connection between the debt and the property (FNB\u2019s vehicles); (iii) the property owner (FNB) did not detriment SARS by placing the property (the vehicles) in the possession of the debtor hence there is no reason why the property owner should be subjected to interference or sanction.</p> \n\n<p>The Court therefore found section 114 of the Act unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed SARS to detain and sell seized property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.</p></div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The core of the Constitutional Court\u2019s analysis related to the question whether section 114 of the Act infringed section 25 of the Constitution which provides for the right to property by allowing SARS to seize property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.

The applicant also alleged that the process of enactment failed to comply with various constitutional obligations relating to public participation, accountability, upholding international obligations, and allowing the NPA to properly exercise its functions. The High Court dismissed the constitutional challenges and held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the constitutional challenges as only the Constitutional Court had the authority to determine whether Parliament or the President had failed to fulfil their constitutional obligations.

However, the majority disagreed with the minority view that the Constitution does not oblige the State to establish and maintain an independent corruption fighting body. The majority held that while the Constitution did not expressly demand that a corruption-fighting unit should be established, its scheme taken as a whole and international law agreements which are binding on the state imposed a pressing duty on the state to set up an effective and independent mechanism to prevent and root out corruption. The second issue considered was whether the legislation that gave effect to the DPCI met the requirements of independence and was therefore constitutionally compliant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In considering the legislative provisions governing the DPCI, the majority held that it did not meet the constitutional requirement of appropriate independence. The reason for the majority&rsquo;s conclusion was that the DPCI was insufficiently protected from political influence in its structure and functioning.

In relation to section 37 of the Constitution, Ngcobo J pointed out that section 37(4)(b)(i) requires legislation that derogates from the Bill of Rights to be &ldquo;consistent with the Republic&rsquo;s obligations under international law applicable to states of emergency.&rdquo; This provision together with sections 39 and 233 of the Constitution indicate that international law has a special place in our law according to Ngcobo J. Ngcobo J, however, held that while section 7(2) of the Constitution gives rise to an obligation on the state to fight corruption and organised crime, it did not specifically impose an obligation on the state to establish an independent corruption-fighting unit. It further held that, insofar as such a constitutional obligation is found, the structural and operational autonomy of the DPCI was secured through institutional and legal mechanisms that were adequately designed to prevent undue interference and safeguarded the independence of the DPCI.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The issue before the court was whether the national legislation that created DPCI and disbanded the DSO, is constitutionally valid.

Respondents stated that <strong>sections 26 and 28 of the Constitution of South Africa</strong> guaranteed the right of everyone to access to adequate housing and the right of children to be afforded special protection, and, in particular, shelter.

The Court held that the State had to create the conditions for access to adequate housing for people at all economic levels of society. The extent of the State&#39;s obligation was defined by three key elements, which had to be considered separately: the obligation to take reasonable legislative and other measures; to achieve the progressive realisation of section 26; and within available resources. For a person to have access to adequate housing, the Court held that there had to be the provision of land, services (such as the provision of water, the removal of sewage and the financing of all these) and a dwelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court further held that <strong>section 26</strong> placed an obligation on the State and all other entities and persons to desist from preventing or impairing the right of access to adequate housing.

A reasonable housing program, capable of facilitating the realisation of the right, had clearly required the State to allocate responsibilities and tasks to the different spheres of government and ensure that the appropriate financial and human resources were available to implement it. The formation of a program, however, was only the first stage in meeting the State&#39;s obligations. The program also had to be reasonably implemented, as failure to do so would not constitute compliance with the State&#39;s obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court found that &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; requires that a program implemented in order to realise a socio-economic right must be &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo;, &ldquo;coherent&rdquo;, &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; and &ldquo;flexible&rdquo;. More importantly, the Court insisted that a &ldquo;program that excludes a significant sector of society cannot be said to be reasonable&rdquo;. On this basis, The Court found the state housing program to be invalid to the extent that it failed to make provision for people in immediate and desperate need. The program, although laudable, concentrated unduly on the goal of constructing permanent houses for as many people as possible over time, instead of providing some form of shelter for the desperate in the interim. Therefore, the Court issued a declaratory order which required the State to design and implement a programme that included measures to provide relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the Constitutional Court declared that the government had not met its constitutional obligations and ordered the government, within its available resources, to devise, fund, implement and supervise measures to provide relief for all who are in desperate need.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Court considered whether the measures taken by the State to realise the right to access to housing afforded by <strong>section 26<strong> of the Constitution were reasonable, and whether the City of Cape Town&rsquo;s housing programmes met the obligations imposed on them by <strong>section 26</strong>.

One of the founding values of our constitutional democracy is &ldquo;a multi-party system of democratic government, to ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness.&rdquo; This founding value must be given expression at the level of national, provincial and local government. Thus one of the objects of local government is &ldquo;to provide democratic and accountable government for local communities&rdquo;. The purpose of section 155(3)(b) is &ldquo;to guard against political interference in the process of creating new municipalities.&rdquo; For, if municipalities were to be established along party lines or if there was to be political interference in their establishment, this would undermine our multi-party system of democratic government. A deliberate decision was therefore made to confer the power to establish municipal areas upon an independent authority. In coming to this conclusion, the Court considered its judgment in Executive Council, Western Cape v Minister of Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development where it found that constitutional &ldquo;authority to determine municipal boundaries vests solely in the Demarcation Board.&rdquo; That authority extends to all categories of municipality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court found that the Municipal Demarcation Board was an independent authority vested with the power to draw municipal boundaries. In giving this board the power, the Constitution sought to prevent political interference in the process of creating municipal boundaries. However, this power was limited by the authority of Parliament to draw provincial boundaries. For the Court, it was inevitable that the alteration of provincial boundaries would impact on municipal boundaries. This was implicit in the power to alter provincial boundaries. Therefore, the Court found that the Twelfth Amendment did not violate <strong>the Constitution</strong> in interfering with municipal boundaries in the course of redrawing provincial boundaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With respect to the second issue, the Court raised doubt regarding whether the national legislative process for constitutional amendments was properly followed.

On this basis, the Court rejected the suggestion that the learner could attend another school as the Constitution requires for difference to be reasonably accommodated and celebrated. The Court ruled that the constitutional rights and protections namely, under <strong>sections 15 and 31</strong> applied equally to both compulsory and voluntary (non-compulsory) practices of culture and religion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court noted that the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of religion or culture under <strong>section 9 of the Constitution</strong> is different from the protection of religion in <strong>section 15</strong> and culture in <strong>sections 30 and 31</strong> under the separate constitutional rights, even if there is overlap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court observed that: (i) religion generally relates to personal faith and belief; (ii) culture relates to traditions and beliefs developed by a community; (iii) there is an overlap between the two as religious practices are often influenced by faith and custom, while cultural beliefs are often built on a community&rsquo;s underlying religious or spiritual beliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is interesting to note that, in her partial dissent, O&rsquo;Regan J had the following to say in relation to the right to religion and culture: She contends that although it is not easy to divine a sharp dividing line between the two, it does seem to me that our Constitution recognises that culture is not the same as religion, and should not always be treated as if it is. Religion is dealt with without mention of culture in <strong>section 15</strong>, which entrenches the right to freedom of belief and conscience. By associating religion with belief and conscience, which involve an individual&rsquo;s state of mind, religion is understood in an individualist sense: a set of beliefs that an individual may hold regardless of the beliefs of others. The exclusion of culture from <strong>section 15</strong> suggests that culture is different. The inclusion of culture in <strong>section 30</strong> and <strong>section 31</strong> makes it clear that by and large culture as conceived in our Constitution, involves associative practices and not individual beliefs. So, <strong>section 31</strong> speaks of the right of persons who are members of religious, linguistic or cultural communities &ldquo;with other members of that community&rdquo; to enjoy their culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, religion, according to O&rsquo;Regan J, need not be associative at all. A religious belief can be entirely personal. The importance of a personal religious belief is more often than not based on a particular relationship with a deity or deities that may have little bearing on community or associative practices. Where one is dealing with personal and individualised belief, religion is to be considered differently to culture, as the Constitution makes clear. In such circumstances, it is appropriate for a court to ask whether the belief is sincerely held in order to decide whether a litigant has established that it falls within the scope of section 15. If a sincere religious belief is established, it seems correct that a court will not investigate the belief further as the cases cited by the Chief Justice in his judgment make plain. A religious belief is personal, and need not be rational, nor need it be shared by others. A court must simply be persuaded that it is a profound and sincerely held belief.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Constitutional Court had to determine whether the school infringed the learner&rsquo;s cultural and religious rights under <strong>sections 9 and 31 of the Constitution</strong> through the application of its Code of Conduct.

Transfer of any property may not be approved without a clearance certificate issued by the municipality as proof that such consumption charges have been paid. At the core of the challenge was that these provisions gave rise to arbitrary deprivation of property and violated the protection afforded in terms of <strong>section 25(1) of the Constitution</strong>. The South Eastern Cape Local Division of the High Court (the High Court) declared <strong>section 118(1)</strong> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> unconstitutional in the Mkontwana matter and Bisset matter and these matters were referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm the confirmation of constitutional invalidity. In both these matters the Minister responsible for Local Government opposed the confirmation and appealed the High Court&rsquo;s order. The third matter, the Transfer Rights Action Campaign matter concerned an application for direct access to the Constitutional Court, relating to the constitutionality of national, provincial and local government legislation including <strong>section 118(1)</strong> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em>. The Constitutional Court granted the application for direct access concerning only the interpretation of <strong>section 118(1)</strong> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> and <strong>section 50(1)(a)</strong> of the Ordinance.</strong></p>", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2004/9/eng@2004-10-06", "id": "MkontwanavNelsonMandelaMetropolitanMunicipalityZACCSACCBCLRCC", "interpretation": "<div>\r\n<p>The Court then turned to the question whether these provisions resulted in a deprivation of property. <strong>Section 25(1)(a) of the Constitution</strong> strictly provides protection against deprivation of property and provides that &ldquo;no law may permit arbitrary deprivation of property&rdquo;. The Court recognised that almost all the parties were in agreement that <strong>section 118(1)</strong> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> and <strong>section 50(1)(a)</strong> of the <em>Ordinance</em> brought about deprivation of property. The Court dismissed the argument that these provisions were only regulatory in nature and held that a <strong>&ldquo;substantial interference&rdquo;</strong> with the enjoyment or use of property that goes beyond the normal restrictions would amount to deprivation. The deprivation here was that owners were unable to transfer their properties unless consumption charges due by people other than themselves and for which they were not liable had been paid. The Court then turned to whether this deprivation was arbitrary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court held that there must be <strong>&ldquo;sufficient reason&rdquo;</strong> for the deprivation or else it would be arbitrary, and the greater the deprivation the more compelling the reason for such deprivation must be. The Court reasoned that the requirement served the important purpose of encouraging payment and considering the various categories of occupiers, the owner is usually in a position to take reasonable steps to prevent the unreasonable accumulation of outstanding consumption charges. It was therefore reasonable for the owner to bear this risk. Even in the case of unlawful occupiers, the owner is in the position to take reasonable steps to ensure it is not unlawfully occupied, by securing the property and instituting eviction proceedings to ensure such occupiers do not remain on the property for long. The deprivation in question related to one element of ownership (the right to alienate property). The Court emphasised that this was not an insubstantial deprivation as the provision requires the owner of the property to bear the risk of non-payment of consumption charges by non-owner occupiers. The Court stated that the relationship between the owner, the property and the consumption charge was sufficiently close to require the owner to bear the risk of non-payment and <strong>section 118(1)</strong> was not found to be arbitrary, Similarly, in cases of unlawful occupation the burden placed on the owner was held not to render <strong>section 118(1)</strong> arbitrary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court also held that that procedural fairness necessitates that all municipalities must, on the written request of owners, provide owners with copies of electricity and water accounts sent to occupiers.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>One of the core issues the Constitutional Court had to determine was whether <strong>section 118(1)</strong> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> and <strong>section 50(1)(a)</strong> of the <em>Ordinance</em> were consistent with <strong>section 25 of the Constitution</strong>.

The High Court found section 12(1)(a) of the Act had a &ldquo;chilling&rdquo; and deterring effect on section 17 of the Constitution and unjustifiably limited the right.

The Court states that the right to privacy covers the right to live life as one pleases.

The Court highlighted that an individual&rsquo;s HIV status deserves protection against unwarranted disclosure due to the negative social connotations associated with the disease and potential discrimination. Parties must balance the need for access to information against the right to privacy in all cases and not only when other fundamental rights are at play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court held that there must be a compelling social need for this expectation of privacy to be violated.

Sections 25 and 26 create an overlap between land rights and socio-economic rights and it is the duty of the state to fulfil both rights. The court held that the provisions of <strong>section 25, subsections 4-9</strong> must be borne in mind whenever <strong>section 25</strong> was being construed; this is because under the Constitution, the protection of property as an individual right was not absolute but subject to societal considerations. The Court also held that the state has a duty to satisfy both property and housing rights provided for in <strong>sections 25 and 26 of the Constitution and must seek to balance these rights</strong> Section 26(3) of the Constitution demonstrates special constitutional consideration for a person&rsquo;s home and acknowledges that a home is more than just a shelter from the elements, but is also an area of personal intimacy and family security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court furthermore held that the <em>Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act 19 of 1998 (PIE)</em> cannot simply be looked at as a legislative mechanism to re-establish common law property rights. The first part of the title of PIE emphasised a shift in focus from preventing illegal squatting to preventing illegal evictions. Under PIE squatting was decriminalised and evictions were subject to requirements in line with the Bill of Rights. The provisions of PIE must be considered against the values of South Africa&rsquo;s new constitutional dispensation. In making its decision, the court must consider all relevant circumstances, including the manner in which occupation was effected, its duration and the availability of suitable alternative accommodation or land, the motivation for settling on land, the degree of desperation of people who have sought land, and whether people occupied land with a plausible belief that they have permission to be there (as opposed to those who deliberately invade land to deliberately disrupt the organised housing programme and place themselves at the front of the queue). Regarding suitable alternative accommodation, the Court emphasised that this will vary from municipality to municipality and depends on the number of people facing eviction in each case and whether the municipality is able to secure suitable accommodation for unlawful occupiers without prejudicing the claims of lawful occupiers and those in line for formal housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court held that considering the period which the occupiers have lived on the land, the fact that eviction is not necessary for the land to be used productively and that this is a relatively small group of people who appear to be genuinely homeless and in need, it would not be just and equitable to order the eviction. The application for leave to appeal was dismissed with costs.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Constitutional Court had to determine whether the decision of the SCA to set aside the eviction order should be overturned.

The Court found that the powers afforded to the applicant were executive in nature and as such subject to be reviewed by a court of law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Court found that that section 82(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> contained non-statutory powers which included the power to grant pardons. These powers did not derive their authority from any legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These powers were not legislative or judicial. Therefore, they are executive in nature as there is no fourth branch of government. This was supported by <strong>section 83</strong> of the Interim Constitution which refers to section 82 powers as &ldquo;executive acts&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, when the President exercises constitutional powers in terms of section 82(1) of the Interim Constitution, he acts as an executive organ of government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since all organs of state are subject to the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, all exercises of presidential power are subject to the provisions of the Interim Constitution, which include the Bill of Rights. Therefore, the President&rsquo;s exercise of constitutionally derived powers can be reviewed by courts of law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court found that the powers afforded to the President under <strong>section 82</strong> could be exercised without the approval of the Cabinet but the President needed to consult with the Executive Deputy Presidents (as per section 82(1) of the Interim Constitution) before exercising this power. The President was not however bound by their views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court added that the section 82(1) of the Interim Constitution placed specific matters within the power of the President. It emphasised that this did not mean that if a President were to abuse this power vested in him or her under section 82(1)(k) a court would be powerless, for it was implicit in the Interim Constitution that the President will exercise that power in good faith. If, for instance, a President were to abuse his or her powers by acting in bad faith the Court saw no reason why a court should not intervene to correct such action and to declare it to be unconstitutional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Respondent sought to review the exercise of the President&rsquo;s power on the basis that it violated the Bill of Rights by unfairly discriminating against him on the basis of sex or gender. The Court held that the pardoning of certain mothers with children under the age of 12 targeted a particular group of prisoners and was therefore discriminatory on the combined basis of sex and parenthood of children below the age of 12. A finding that discrimination occurred is not the end of the inquiry as the Interim Constitution only prohibits discrimaintion that is unfair. To determine whether the discrimination was unfair the Court looked at the impact of the discrimination. According to the Court, the impact on fathers of young children who were not released was found not to significantly compromise the dignity and worth of the men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the pardon did not discriminate unfairly because the discretion to pardon was with the applicant and the pardon did not prevent fathers from directly applying to the applicant to be pardoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court concluded that the President had exercised his discretion fairly and in a manner that was consistent with the Interim Constitution.

The Court affirmed that the rights that individuals enjoy in terms of section 27 of the Constitution are dependent upon the resources available for such purposes, and that the corresponding rights themselves are limited by the lack of resources. The Court found that the provincial health department&rsquo;s resources were already severely strained and that if the Court were to decide that treatment had to be provided to Mr Soobramoney it would also have to be provided to all others in a similar position and the resources available to the hospital could not accommodate the demand.

The applicants&rsquo; argued that it was not rational for a convener of a gathering to take all reasonable steps to prevent an act or omission even if that act or omission was not reasonably foreseeable. Mogoeng CJ, considered the meaning of the provision and held that there is a connection between the steps that a convener takes, within its power, and preventing harm that is reasonably foreseeable. If appropriate steps are adopted when planning a gathering and these steps are reasonable to prevent foreseeable outcomes, the taking of such steps would render any act or omission that resulted in riot damage to be classified as reasonably unforeseeable. The defence was therefore found to be rational.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mogoeng CJ, then turned to considered whether the provision limited section 17 of the Constitution. Mogoeng J held that section 11(2) of the Regulation of Gatherings Act does limit section 17 of the Constitution as it requires conveners of gatherings to adhere to the requirements and can potentially increase the cost of organising a protest which could bar under-resourced organisations from being able to protest. The question was whether this limitation could be justified in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution as a reasonable and justifiable limitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On conducting the limitation analysis in terms of section 36 of the Constitution, and looking at the importance of the right to assemble, the Court emphasised that the right to freedom of assembly is central to our constitutional democracy. It exists to give a voice to less powerful people in society and groups that do not wield political or economic power and other vulnerable persons. The right may be the only mechanism for such persons to express their concerns. Bearing in mind the significance of this right, the purpose of the limitation must be important enough to justify the limitation. The Court held that the purpose of the limitation, to protect individuals, especially those who themselves are under-resourced, who suffer damages caused by protests, is a crucial one. The Court reasoned that the public has no means to control protests whereas organisers are in a position to control and manage protests. Organizations have a choice between exercising the right to assemble or abandoning protests in order to prevent reasonably foreseeable damage. Conversely, victims of riot damage have no choice regarding what may happen to them or their property. Therefore, the Court held that the justification provided for by the law was viable and that the limitation on the right to freedom of assembly in <strong>section 17 of the Constitution</strong> was held to be reasonable and justifiable. The Court emphasized that the Regulation of Gatherings Act does not nullify the right to freedom of assembly, but imposes strict conditions on the right in order to prevent injury to persons or property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a concurring judgment, Jafta J held that the appeal should be dismissed, on the basis that the applicants had failed to prove that section 11(2) of the Regulations of Gatherings Act limited the right to freedom of assembly.

The minority agreed that criminalisation of sex work did not infringe the rights to human dignity and economic activity, and that any limitation on privacy was reasonably justifiable. However, the minority judgement found that the criminalisation of sex work reinforces double standards and gender stereotypes by making patrons accomplices to the crime at most and in contrast, making the sex worker the primary offender and this constituted unfair discrimination</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<div>\r\n<p>Various constitutional challenges were raised against the Sexual Offences Act.

First, it is as a guiding principle in each case that deals with a particular child. Secondly, it is a standard against which to test provisions or conduct which affect children in general. The Court added that the best-interests principle is not only limited to scenarios where legislation is inflexible, the principle also applies in circumstances where a statutory provision is shown to be against the best interests of children in general, for whatever reason. As a matter of logic what is bad for all children will be bad for one child in a particular case. Thus, if there is evidence that exposing children to the criminal justice system for engaging in consensual sexual behaviour has a negative impact on them generally, then a Court may declare the scheme to be contrary to the best interests of the child in terms of section 28(2), and therefore invalid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, <strong>section 28</strong> is both a self-standing right and a guiding principle in respect of all matters affecting the child. What is in the best interests of the child in each case will require a consideration of various factors. Further, it is not necessary that the specific interests of the child in the case before the court are affected, but rather whether the interests of children in general are affected. Legislation would be inconsistent with this right if it is demonstrated to be against the interests of children in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court found that sections 15 and 16 of the Act were unconstitutional in that they infringed the rights of adolescents (12- to 16-year olds) to dignity and privacy, and further in that they violated the best-interests principle contained in <strong>section 28(2) of the Constitution</strong>. The Court held that the sections infringed the best-interests principle in many ways. Most importantly, the offences created by the provisions ran the risk of exposing children to the harmful effects of the criminal justice system and could undermine support structures by deterring adolescents from seeking help and could create a breakdown in parental care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relying on expert evidence, the Court concluded that the provisions criminalized what constituted developmentally normal conduct for adolescents, and adversely affected the very children the Act sought to protect. The effects of the provisions were found not to be rationally related to the State&rsquo;s purpose of protecting children. The Court then found that the infringement of the best-interests principle cannot be justified in terms of section 36 of the Constitution as was no evidence that criminalising such consensual sexual behaviour would deter adolescents from engaging in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the Constitutional Court declared the sections 15 and 16 of the Act invalid to the extent that they criminalized consensual sexual conduct between adolescents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Constitutional Court suspended the declaration of invalidity for 18 months to allow Parliament to amend the provisions.

Kondile AJ, writing for the majority, started the equality analysis by firstly considering, whether the provision differentiated between categories of people and if there was such differentiation whether there was a legitimate rationale for such differentiation. During this first leg of the analysis, looking at the rational connection between the provision and its purpose, the Court emphasised that the private security industry was a special environment and at stake was the safety and security of the public at large. <strong>Section 12 of the Constitution</strong> provides everyone with the right to freedom and security of the person, which includes the right to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources. In a society rife with violent crime, the importance of protecting this right could not be exaggerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority judgment held that the regulatory scheme was carefully designed for the purpose of screening entrants to the private security industry rather than constituting a blanket ban on the registration of refugees as private security service providers. That is not to say that foreign nationals, including refugees, are inherently less trustworthy than South Africans. In a country where xenophobia has caused increased suffering, it was important to stress this and explain that it was not that the Authority did not trust refugees. The Security Act was designed to limit eligibility for registration to people whose trustworthiness could be objectively verified, and it was easier to verify the trustworthiness of citizens and permanent residents. The preamble to the Act acknowledges that the right to security of the person is fundamental to the well-being and to the social and economic development of every person. The Court therefore held that the differentiation between citizens and permanent residents on one hand and other foreigners in this instance, was rational and served a legitimate government purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On establishing differentiation, the majority judgment then considered whether the differentiation amounted to discrimination. The Court held that in this instance, the differentiation was on grounds analogous to those listed in section 9(3) of the Constitution, and therefore constituted discrimination. The analysis then turned to whether the discrimination was unfair. Various factors were considered by the Court on the question of fairness, such as the fact that while refugees were fully entitled to work in South Africa, <strong>section 22 of the Constitution</strong> limited the right to choose a job to citizens only. The Court also considered that refugees could be registered as security service providers if the requirements of section 23(6) of the Security Act were met and that there was no complete exclusion of refugees from being registered. The majority found that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act did not unfairly discriminate against the applicants and was therefore constitutionally sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their dissenting judgment, Mokgoro J and O&#39;Regan J held that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act discriminated unfairly on the basis of refugee status. The joint dissenting judgment was not convinced that the purpose identified by the Minister to ensure that security service employees were trustworthy was really intended by the section. The dissenting judgment stated that the order it would have proposed was to require that refugees who could meet the other requirements of the Security Act should not be barred from registration as security service providers.

The High Court agreed and declared certain words in section 65J(2) of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act  unconstitutional to the extent that it failed to provide for judicial oversight over the issuing of an emoluments attachment order against a judgment debtor. The High Court also declared that section 45 of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act does not permit a debtor to consent in writing to the jurisdiction of a magistrates\u2019 court other than that in which that debtor resides or is employed.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>The issue was whether a debtor's section 34 right of access to court is breached when an execution process against any type of property occurs without judicial oversight by a court.</p>", "title": "University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic and Others v Minister of Justice and Correctional Services and Others; Association of Debt Recovery Agents NPC v University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic and Others (CCT 127/15) [2016] ZACC 32", "topics": ["sec_34__Access_to_Courts"]}, {"date_updated": "2024-04-11T07:35:22.609648+00:00", "facts_and_issues": "<p>Mr Jacobs was in a motor vehicle accident and suffered severe head injuries that impaired his mental capacity.

However, there was relic law from the apartheid era, Proclamation R293 of 1962, issued in terms of the Administration Act of 1927. This Proclamation governed the setting-up of special African townships by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in areas under the African Native Trust. This Proclamation was one of the tools with which the apartheid state disposed Africans from landholding and created barriers to Africans owning any land. Instead, Africans could only hold rights to the lands through an insecure tenure system of Deeds of Grant and Certificates of Occupancy and letting for residential purposes. The township manager had the authority to cancel this tenure at any point. Special deeds registries were created to register the deeds of grant under the legislation.</p>\n<p>When South Africa transitioned to democratic majority rule, the President, empowered by the Interim Constitution, passed Proclamation R9 of 1997 together with amendments to the Deeds Registry Act. The impact of these changes was to regularise and create a more uniform approach to registration of titles in immovable property. The President also delegated certain legislative competencies to the provincial legislations to ensure multi-level governance.\u00a0<br>Consequently, the North West passed the North West Act 7 which supposedly repealed the whole of Proclamation R293.

The court held that, while a delay in applying is relevant in determining whether an application is authentic, such a delay could not function as an absolute disqualification from initiating the asylum application process, and that the amendments to the Refugees Act did not change section 2, which provides for the principle of <em>non-refoulement</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, the court also had to determine whether Mr A.&rsquo;s continued detention was lawful or justified in terms of <strong>section 36 of the Constitution</strong>. The court held that certain periods of Mr A.&rsquo;s detention were unlawful, such as when he had paid the required fine, and the periods when his detention was not authorized by a court order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The court ordered the respondents to take all reasonable steps, within 14 days from the date of the order, to give effect to Mr A.&rsquo;s intention to apply for asylum in terms of section 21(1B) of the Refugees Amendment Act.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p><strong>Section 36</strong>&nbsp;provides criteria for circumstances when rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights may be limited.

The applicants argued that neither of these categories of persons were able to retain or obtain South African citizenship following the 2010 Amendment.

The Constitutional Court held that it was clear that section 2(1)(a) retains citizenship only for those who were considered &ldquo;citizens by birth&rdquo; before the commencement of the 2010 Amendment. This could create an anomaly as persons who acquired citizenship by descent under the previous version of the Citizenship Act would now be excluded. This apparent exclusion could be resolved by adopting a purposive interpretation of section 2(1)(b).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court interpreted the term &lsquo;is born&rsquo; in section 2(1)(b) as a &ldquo;state of being&rdquo; not indicative of a tense, but rather including all persons regardless of when they were born. The Court held that this was a reasonable and constitutionally compliant interpretation which meant that section 2 was applicable to persons born to a South African parent before and after 1 January 2013, curing the anomaly.</p>\r\nThis interpretation allowed for all categories of citizens who acquired citizenship by birth or descent in terms of the previous version of the Citizenship Act to be included. As the 2010 Amendment could be interpreted in a constitutionally compliant manner, the findings of invalidity in the High Court were not confirmed by the Constitutional Court.\r\n\r\n<p>The Constitutional Court thereby ensured that the sections of the 2010 Amendment would be interpreted and applied consistently with <strong>section 20 of the Constitution</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(i) On section 20 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court held that although the importance of citizenship should not be overemphasised, citizenship is a gateway right to many other constitutional rights &ndash; namely, freedom of movement, freedom of trade and political rights, and is more than a legal status. Citizenship related to the core of a person&rsquo;s identity, a sense of belonging in a community and to security of a person most especially in communities rife with xenophobia. Deprivation of, or interference with, a person&rsquo;s citizenship status affects their private and family life, their choices concerning where establish their homes, apply for jobs, enrol in schools; whether they can form part of the community; their ability to participate fully in the political activity and governance; and the extent to which they may exercise freedom of movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) The Constitutional Court held that whilst certain rights in the Constitution are only available to South African citizens, drawing arbitrary and irrational distinctions between citizens and non-citizens through legislation or decision-making is inconsistent with the Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iii) Legislation must be interpreted to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, but any interpretation must remain consistent with the text of the legislation. The Constitutional Court interpreted <strong>section 2(1) of the 2010 Amendment</strong> by analysing the plain meaning of the words, the context of the case and section&rsquo;s purpose in light of the Bill of Rights. The Constitutional Court adopted an interpretation that was consistent with and promoted both the text of the section (by recognising that the section&rsquo;s language is not time-specific but rather linked to a condition of having been born) as well as the Bill of Rights (not to arbitrarily deprive persons of their citizenship overnight, as required by section 20 linked to other constitutional rights).</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<div>\r\n<p>Based on the Respondents&rsquo; interpretation of the 2010 Amendment, the applicants were unable to gain citizenship, despite having the right to gain citizenship under the previous version of the Citizenship Act had they registered their births.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Section 20 of the Constitution provides that: &lsquo;No citizen may be deprived of citizenship&#39;.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue before the Constitutional Court was whether it was possible to interpret section 2(1) of the 2010 Amendment in a manner constitutionally complaint with section 20 of the Constitution.

The owner of the property (Blue Moonlight) approached the South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg seeking an order to evict the occupiers in order to develop the property. The occupiers opposed the eviction on the basis that it would almost certainly render them homeless and argued that the City of Johannesburg (the City) had an obligation to provide them with temporary housing under the Constitution and the <strong>Prevention of Illegal Eviction and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act, 19 of 1998 (PIE)</strong> before they could be evicted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The High Court granted the eviction order, but also ordered the City to remedy its housing policy as it was found to be unconstitutional and the High Court issued a structural interdict against the City obliging the City to report back to the High Court on the steps taken remedying its housing policy. The City was also ordered to provide temporary housing to the occupiers and to pay Blue Moonlight compensation until the eviction date. The City subsequently appealed the High Court&rsquo;s order to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). The SCA only set aside the structural interdict against the City and the High Court&rsquo;s compensation order and declared the City&rsquo;s housing policy unconstitutional to the extent that it excluded the occupiers from temporary housing and the City was ordered to provide them with &ldquo;temporary emergency accommodation&rdquo;. The City appealed the SCA&rsquo;s order to the Constitutional Court.</p>\r\n</div>", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2011/33/eng@2011-12-01", "id": "CityofJohannesburgMetropolitanMunicipalityvBlueMoonlightPropertiesPtyLtdandAnotherCCZACCBCLRCCSACC", "interpretation": "<div>\r\n<p>In a unanimous judgment by Van der Westhuizen J, the Court held that an owner&#39;s constitutional right not to be deprived of property must be interpreted in the social and historical context and be balanced against the right of access to adequate housing and not to be evicted arbitrarily from one&#39;s home. The Court emphasised that apartheid legislation undermined both the right of access to adequate housing and the right to property. Section 25 prohibits arbitrary deprivation of property, but also undertakes to redress unequal social conditions.</p>\r\nSection 26 of the Constitution &ldquo;highlights the transformative vision of the Constitution&rdquo; and PIE was enacted to specifically prevent the historical abuse of displacement of people. In this case, even though housing unlawful occupiers indefinitely suspends an owner&#39;s right to use and enjoy property, evictions can only be carried out in terms of PIE. PIE allows for the eviction of unlawful occupiers only in circumstances where such eviction is just and equitable.\r\n\r\n<p>In deciding whether an eviction is just and equitable in terms of PIE, the Court considered that many of the occupiers had lived on the property for a very long time, the occupation had once been lawful, Blue Moonlight was aware of the occupiers&rsquo; presence when it purchased the property, and the eviction of the occupiers would render them homeless while there was no competing risk of homelessness on the part of Blue Moonlight. Furthermore, the Court held that a key consideration was whether the City had made reasonable efforts to provide alternative accommodation to the occupiers. After considering the City&rsquo;s housing policy, the Court noted that the policy differentiated between persons relocated by the City itself and those evicted by private landowners. However, where relocation was sought by the City, these persons were housed in temporary accommodation, which was not the case with persons evicted by private landowners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court emphasised that section 26(2) of the Constitution recognises that the state is constrained by resources in giving effect to the right to adequate housing and therefore a housing policy may differentiate and give preference to categories of people; however any differentiation must be rational. The City&rsquo;s housing policy was found to be &ldquo;rigid&rdquo;. The Court held that the policy failed to take into account whether emergency accommodation should be made available in individual cases, considering the categories of persons affected (such as elderly people and children) and their circumstances, and that an imminent eviction might render them homeless, regardless of whether the eviction or relocation is sought by the City or a private landowner. The Court held that this differentiation was not rational. Where an eviction may result in homelessness, it is irrelevant whether such eviction is at the instance of the City or a private landowner. The Court emphasised that this matter concerns &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; accommodation in an emergency as defined in Chapter 12 of the National Housing Code and not &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; housing. The obligation, while derived from the right to progressive realisation of adequate housing in terms of <strong>section 26(2) of the Constitution</strong>, is distinct from the obligation to address permanent housing needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court therefore declared the City&rsquo;s housing policy unconstitutional and in violation of section 26 of the Constitution to the extent that it excluded people evicted by private landowners from its temporary housing programme. The Court dismissed the City&rsquo;s appeal and held that the occupiers had to vacate the properties by a given date. The Court stipulated that the City was to provide the evictees with &quot;temporary accommodation in a location as near as feasibly possible to the area&quot; in which the building was situated, in order to ensure that the occupiers were not rendered homeless between the date of eviction and the date by which the City would have to provide emergency housing.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation.

The City argued that local government does not have a primary role in fulfilling the right to access to adequate housing and that this mandate falls on the shoulders of the national and provincial government. The City argued that it fulfilled its duties after requesting assistance from provincial government and no more could be expected from it. The occupiers opposed the City&rsquo;s appeal and also applied for a conditional cross-appeal requesting that an order of eviction be linked to the condition that suitable alternative accommodation be provided and that the City report back on steps taken to remedying its housing policy.</p>", "snippet": "<p>The Court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation.</p>", "title": "City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality v Blue Moonlight Properties 39 (Pty) Ltd and Another (CC) [2011] ZACC 33; 2012 (2) BCLR 150 (CC); 2012 (2) SA 104 (CC)", "topics": ["sec_26__Housing"]}, {"date_updated": "2024-04-11T07:35:20.869277+00:00", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The Premier of Mpumalanga, acting under section 121 of the Constitution, referred the Mpumalanga Petitions Bill to the Constitutional Court so they could decide on the constitutionality of the Bill because he had two reservations about its constitutionality. </p>", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2001/10/eng@2001-10-05", "id": "ConstitutionalityoftheMpumalangaPetitionsBillZACCSACCBCLR", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court found that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the first issue because the Premier had not followed the process set out for him in <b>section 121 of the Constitution</b>.

The Court held that whether private persons will be bound by section 8(2) depends on a number of factors:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(i) What is the nature of the right? (Is the obligation positive or negative? That is, does the obligation require something to be done, or for the party to abstain from doing something?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(ii) What is the history of the right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iii) What does the right seek to achieve?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(iv) How best can that be chieved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(v) What is the &ldquo;potential of invasion of that right by persons other than the State or organs of State?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(vi) Would letting private persons off the net not negate the essential content of the right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madlanga J stressed that after weighing up these factors one concludes that private persons are bound and must bear a positive obligation, then such an obligation must be imposed and <strong>section 8(2)</strong> does envisage that such obligation can be imposed.

The decisive question is whether private persons should be bound by the right in the Bill of Rights. In relation to security of tenure, the duty (both positive and negative) imposed by the right to security of tenure does in fact rest on private persons. People in need of protection under ESTA often reside on land owned by private persons, as in this case. The obligation resting on an owner is a positive one. A private party is required by <strong>section 25(6) of the Constitution</strong> through ESTA to accommodate another on their land.

In this analysis the Court considered various foreign law precedents and held that only judicial officers, who have true structural and constitutional independence, can commit a witness to prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority therefore held  that <b>section 66(3)</b> infringed <b>section 12(1)(b) of the Constitution</b> only to the extent that a person who is not a magistrate is authorised by the subsection to issue a warrant committing to prison an examinee at a creditors meeting held under section 65 of the Insolvency Act. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Didcott J, in a minority judgment, disagreed that <b>section 66(3)</b> of the <em>Insolvency Act</em> would be invalid where it empowered a presiding officer who was not a magistrate to issue a warrant of committal to prison. Didcott J contended that a non-magistrate presiding officer would not necessarily be any less independent and impartial in applying the law than a magistrate, and in any event an aggrieved party could approach the High Court and thus involve the judiciary if dissatisfied with the procedure or imprisonment, and that accordingly, <b>section 66(3)</b> of the <em>Insolvency Act</em> would not infringe the rule of law or the doctrine of separation of powers as judicial redress was available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O\u2019 Regan J, in a separate minority judgment, disagreed with the majority judgment and held that the focus should be whether there are appropriate safeguards accompanying the deprivation of freedom and held that it is a procedural requirement that no person may be imprisoned indefinitely for coercive purposes except by a court of law and  as such a meeting is not a court of law, even if its is presided over by a magistrate, <b>section 66(3)</b> of the <em>Insolvency Act</em> unjustifiably  infringes on <b>section 12 of the Constitution</b>.</p></div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>On determining the constitutional validity of <b>section 66(3)</b> of the <em>Insolvency Act</em>, the applicant argued that <b>section 66(3)</b> of the <em>Insolvency Act</em> unduly limited <b>section 12(1)(a) of the Constitution</b> which guarantees that a person may <b>\u201cnot be deprived of freedom arbitrarily or without just cause\u201d</b>.

Where provinces are given exclusive powers in Schedule 5, these apply to matters which can be regulated intra-provincially. Cameron J formulated the &ldquo;pith and substance&rdquo; test for determining legislative competence, which looks at whether the substance of the Bill falls within Schedule 4 or 5.

All provisions which do not fall within the main substance of the Bill are treated as incidental and are disregarded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court was required to individually look at the three main areas of the Bill and determine whether the Bill fell within Schedule 4 or 5 for each area. It was held that the substance of the Bill was directed at three objectives. Firstly, the prohibition of cross-holdings between producers, distributors and retailers, and this was held to be an exclusive national competence. Secondly, the establishment of uniform conditions for national registration of manufacturers and distributors. Here it was held that provincial exclusive competence in relation to liquor licenses was not intended to cover the manufacturing and distribution of liquor because this was not an intra-provincial activity and was therefore an exclusive national competence. The third objective was to prescribe detailed mechanisms to provincial legislators for establishing retail licensing mechanisms. This was found to be an exclusive provincial competence under Schedule 5, which was liquor licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cameron J interpreted &ldquo;liquor licenses&rdquo; in Part A of Schedule 5 as referring to intra-provincial liquor licenses, but he found that even if exclusive provincial competence in respect of liquor licenses did extend to the manufacturing and distribution, national government&rsquo;s interest in maintaining economic unity would enable national government to intervene in terms of Section 44(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court concluded that the Liquor Bill was unconstitutional. In terms of Section 44(2), the national government was justified in intervening and creating a national system of registration for manufacturers and distributors and in prohibiting cross-holdings. However, no case was made out in relation to retail sales of liquor whose operations were exclusively provincial. The Minister had therefore failed to establish that national Parliament had the competence to enact the Liquor Bill and the Bill was declared unconstitutional.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Court had to decide whether the substance of the Liquor Bill (which not only depends on its form but also on its purpose and effect) fell within the concurrent legislative competence of national Parliament and the province or within the exclusive legislative competence of the province.</p>", "snippet": "<p>The Court had to decide whether the substance of the Liquor Bill (which not only depends on its form but also on its purpose and effect) fell within the concurrent legislative competence of national Parliament and the province or within the exclusive legislative competence of the province.</p>", "title": "Ex Parte President of the Republic of South Africa: In re Constitutionality of the Liquor Bill [1999] ZACC 15; 2000 (1) SA 732; 2000 (1) BCLR 1", "topics": ["Co-operative_Government_and_Intergovernmental_Relations", "The_National_Legislative_Process"]}, {"date_updated": "2024-09-13T11:59:39.680701+00:00", "facts_and_issues": "<div>\r\n<p>[Note: This case was decided under the <strong>Interim Constitution</strong>, but the decision remains relevant and applicable.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[The Eastern Metropolitan Substructure, Western Metropolitan Substructure, Southern Metropolitan Substructure and the Northern Metropolitan Substructure were all transitional substructures of the Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council as at June 1996.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The metropolitan structures passed resolutions to substantially increase general rates on property and property rights within the Eastern and Northern Metropolitan Substructure areas, thereby generating surpluses in income from those areas to offset deficits in the budgets of the Western and Southern Metropolitan Substructures and Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council through subsidisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was that ratepayers in some areas were required to pay increased property rates and others enjoyed a decrease in their rates.

The section 25(3) rights only apply to an &ldquo;accused person&rdquo; in a criminal trial. The threat only arises once a person who tendered evidence in a section 417 inquiry is accused in a criminal trial and that evidence tendered is specifically used. Therefore, section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act was not held to constitute an infringement on any section 25(3) rights and the majority dismissed this challenge. The Court then considered the alternative main argument that section 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 infringed sections 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution. The Court held that the analysis contains two stages. One first has to determine whether there was an infringement of sections 11 and 13 of the Constitution. If there was an infringement then one has to analyse whether this infringement may be justified under <strong>s 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> (the limitation clause &ndash; now <strong>section 36 of the Constitution</strong>). On this analysis, the Court held that section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act unduly infringed on section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution and declared it invalid only to the extent that answers given at such an inquiry may be used against such a person in criminal proceedings against the person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that this matter was heard in terms of the Interim Constitution. <strong>Section 36 of the Constitution</strong> (the limitation of rights provision) is the replacement to section 33 of the Interim Constitution. This judgment confirmed that the limitation of rights exercise concerns two stages. The first stage involves a consideration of the scope of the constitutional right and the scope of the challenged law in order to determine whether there has been an infringement. Accordingly, in this case, the Court analysed firstly whether section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act limited <strong>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong>, relating to the right to freedom and security of the person. The Court emphasised that a broad interpretation should be given to the right at this stage as the second stage of the limitation test involving <strong>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> prescribes the criteria that has to be met before an entrenched right can be justifiably limited. The Court held that section 417(2)(b) limited <strong>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> and then turned to the second stage of the limitation test. The second stage involved analysing whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable in a democratic society taking into account the prescribed factors in <strong>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong>. The Court emphasised in this matter that the onus is on the party relying on the legislation to justify the limitation in terms of <strong>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</strong> and not for the party challenging it.

The Court held that the deprivation is arbitrary \u201cwhen the \u2018law\u2019 referred to in section 25(1) does not provide sufficient reason for the particular deprivation in question or is procedurally unfair\u201d. The Court also gave a list of factors to be taken into account to determine whether there is \u2018sufficient reason\u2019, such as the nature and complexity of the relationship between the means and ends; and the nature or type of the right or property in question (i.e. ownership in land or other extensive property rights will require more justification in order to be sufficient).</p>\n\n<p>Following this analysis, the Court held that section 114 of the Act deprived FNB permanently of all its rights and benefits as owner of the vehicles. On applying the test for whether the deprivation was arbitrary or not, and therefore whether the deprivation was constitutional or not, the Court concluded that the deprivation, the seizure by SARS under section 114 of FNB\u2019s vehicles, was arbitrary and unconstitutional because there was insufficient reason justifying it. The Court held that: (i) there was no connection between the debt of the debtors and the owner of the property (FNB); (ii) there was no connection between the debt and the property (FNB\u2019s vehicles); (iii) the property owner (FNB) did not detriment SARS by placing the property (the vehicles) in the possession of the debtor hence there is no reason why the property owner should be subjected to interference or sanction.</p> \n\n<p>The Court therefore found section 114 of the Act unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed SARS to detain and sell seized property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.</p></div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The core of the Constitutional Court\u2019s analysis related to the question whether section 114 of the Act infringed section 25 of the Constitution which provides for the right to property by allowing SARS to seize property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.

The High Court dismissed the constitutional challenges and held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the constitutional challenges as only the Constitutional Court had the authority to determine whether Parliament or the President had failed to fulfil their constitutional obligations.

However, the majority disagreed with the minority view that the Constitution does not oblige the State to establish and maintain an independent corruption fighting body. The majority held that while the Constitution did not expressly demand that a corruption-fighting unit should be established, its scheme taken as a whole and international law agreements which are binding on the state imposed a pressing duty on the state to set up an effective and independent mechanism to prevent and root out corruption. The second issue considered was whether the legislation that gave effect to the DPCI met the requirements of independence and was therefore constitutionally compliant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In considering the legislative provisions governing the DPCI, the majority held that it did not meet the constitutional requirement of appropriate independence. The reason for the majority&rsquo;s conclusion was that the DPCI was insufficiently protected from political influence in its structure and functioning.

The Court held that the State had to create the conditions for access to adequate housing for people at all economic levels of society. The extent of the State&#39;s obligation was defined by three key elements, which had to be considered separately: the obligation to take reasonable legislative and other measures; to achieve the progressive realisation of section 26; and within available resources. For a person to have access to adequate housing, the Court held that there had to be the provision of land, services (such as the provision of water, the removal of sewage and the financing of all these) and a dwelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court further held that <strong>section 26</strong> placed an obligation on the State and all other entities and persons to desist from preventing or impairing the right of access to adequate housing.

A reasonable housing program, capable of facilitating the realisation of the right, had clearly required the State to allocate responsibilities and tasks to the different spheres of government and ensure that the appropriate financial and human resources were available to implement it. The formation of a program, however, was only the first stage in meeting the State&#39;s obligations.

More importantly, the Court insisted that a &ldquo;program that excludes a significant sector of society cannot be said to be reasonable&rdquo;. On this basis, The Court found the state housing program to be invalid to the extent that it failed to make provision for people in immediate and desperate need. The program, although laudable, concentrated unduly on the goal of constructing permanent houses for as many people as possible over time, instead of providing some form of shelter for the desperate in the interim.

Laws inconsistent with the Constitution are &quot;of no force and effect&quot;, and such law has to be declared invalid to the extent of the inconsistency. Laws that are consistent with the Constitution, but inconsistent with each other, will not be invalidated as a result of the inconsistency, but the provisions of one law will prevail over the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The court analyzed the relationship between the powers of the provincial legislatures and the powers of Parliament. The court held that if there is a conflict between a provincial law and a national law, the Constitution provides for the resolution of that conflict by giving priority either to Acts of Parliament or to provincial laws, depending on the circumstances. If there is a conflict, the provisions of the law which prevail must be enforced in all respects. The other law is not invalidated and, for as long as that inconsistency exists, it is inoperative and ineffective only to the extent of the inconsistency and must be implemented in all other respects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Constitution&rsquo;s vesting of concurrent lawmaking powers in Parliament and the provincial legislatures requires consultation and co-operation between the national executive and the provincial executives. The Court found that the Bill, which makes provision for consultation and co-operation in the field of education was consistent with the Constitution. Where both Parliament and the provincial legislatures exercise or wish to exercise concurrent competences, consultation and co-operation are essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court thus declared that the National Education Policy Bill was not unconstitutional.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The main challenge to the Bill was that it required the provinces to promote policies inconsistent with provincial policy and required the provinces to amend their legislation to conform to national education policy, and thereby empowered the Minister to impose national education policy on the provinces.</p>", "snippet": "<p>The main challenge to the Bill was that it required the provinces to promote policies inconsistent with provincial policy and required the provinces to amend their legislation to conform to national education policy, and thereby empowered the Minister to impose national education policy on the provinces.</p>", "title": "In Re: National Education Policy Bill No 83 of 1995 [1996] ZACC 3; 1996 (4) BCLR 518; 1996 (3) SA 289", "topics": ["Legislative_Process_Competence"]}, {"date_updated": "2024-04-11T07:35:21.406909+00:00", "facts_and_issues": "<p>When the term of office of former Chief Justice Ngcobo came to an end, the President extended this term by a further five years.

A deliberate decision was therefore made to confer the power to establish municipal areas upon an independent authority. In coming to this conclusion, the Court considered its judgment in Executive Council, Western Cape v Minister of Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development where it found that constitutional &ldquo;authority to determine municipal boundaries vests solely in the Demarcation Board.&rdquo; That authority extends to all categories of municipality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court found that the Municipal Demarcation Board was an independent authority vested with the power to draw municipal boundaries.

The Court found that permitting this particular exemption would not endanger uniformity or school discipline in general; but rather that granting an exemption to Ms Sunali Pillay (the learner) might encourage more learners to express their religion or culture, which was to be celebrated, and not feared, as diversity itself is to be promoted and celebrated not only tolerated. On this basis, the Court rejected the suggestion that the learner could attend another school as the Constitution requires for difference to be reasonably accommodated and celebrated. The Court ruled that the constitutional rights and protections namely, under <strong>sections 15 and 31</strong> applied equally to both compulsory and voluntary (non-compulsory) practices of culture and religion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court noted that the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of religion or culture under <strong>section 9 of the Constitution</strong> is different from the protection of religion in <strong>section 15</strong> and culture in <strong>sections 30 and 31</strong> under the separate constitutional rights, even if there is overlap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court observed that: (i) religion generally relates to personal faith and belief; (ii) culture relates to traditions and beliefs developed by a community; (iii) there is an overlap between the two as religious practices are often influenced by faith and custom, while cultural beliefs are often built on a community&rsquo;s underlying religious or spiritual beliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is interesting to note that, in her partial dissent, O&rsquo;Regan J had the following to say in relation to the right to religion and culture: She contends that although it is not easy to divine a sharp dividing line between the two, it does seem to me that our Constitution recognises that culture is not the same as religion, and should not always be treated as if it is. Religion is dealt with without mention of culture in <strong>section 15</strong>, which entrenches the right to freedom of belief and conscience. By associating religion with belief and conscience, which involve an individual&rsquo;s state of mind, religion is understood in an individualist sense: a set of beliefs that an individual may hold regardless of the beliefs of others. The exclusion of culture from <strong>section 15</strong> suggests that culture is different. The inclusion of culture in <strong>section 30</strong> and <strong>section 31</strong> makes it clear that by and large culture as conceived in our Constitution, involves associative practices and not individual beliefs. So, <strong>section 31</strong> speaks of the right of persons who are members of religious, linguistic or cultural communities &ldquo;with other members of that community&rdquo; to enjoy their culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, religion, according to O&rsquo;Regan J, need not be associative at all. A religious belief can be entirely personal. The importance of a personal religious belief is more often than not based on a particular relationship with a deity or deities that may have little bearing on community or associative practices. Where one is dealing with personal and individualised belief, religion is to be considered differently to culture, as the Constitution makes clear. In such circumstances, it is appropriate for a court to ask whether the belief is sincerely held in order to decide whether a litigant has established that it falls within the scope of section 15. If a sincere religious belief is established, it seems correct that a court will not investigate the belief further as the cases cited by the Chief Justice in his judgment make plain. A religious belief is personal, and need not be rational, nor need it be shared by others. A court must simply be persuaded that it is a profound and sincerely held belief.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Constitutional Court had to determine whether the school infringed the learner&rsquo;s cultural and religious rights under <strong>sections 9 and 31 of the Constitution</strong> through the application of its Code of Conduct.

Transfer of any property may not be approved without a clearance certificate issued by the municipality as proof that such consumption charges have been paid. At the core of the challenge was that these provisions gave rise to arbitrary deprivation of property and violated the protection afforded in terms of <strong>section 25(1) of the Constitution</strong>. The South Eastern Cape Local Division of the High Court (the High Court) declared <strong>section 118(1)</strong> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> unconstitutional in the Mkontwana matter and Bisset matter and these matters were referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm the confirmation of constitutional invalidity. In both these matters the Minister responsible for Local Government opposed the confirmation and appealed the High Court&rsquo;s order. The third matter, the Transfer Rights Action Campaign matter concerned an application for direct access to the Constitutional Court, relating to the constitutionality of national, provincial and local government legislation including <strong>section 118(1)</strong> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em>.

The Court recognised that almost all the parties were in agreement that <strong>section 118(1)</strong> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> and <strong>section 50(1)(a)</strong> of the <em>Ordinance</em> brought about deprivation of property. The Court dismissed the argument that these provisions were only regulatory in nature and held that a <strong>&ldquo;substantial interference&rdquo;</strong> with the enjoyment or use of property that goes beyond the normal restrictions would amount to deprivation. The deprivation here was that owners were unable to transfer their properties unless consumption charges due by people other than themselves and for which they were not liable had been paid. The Court then turned to whether this deprivation was arbitrary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court held that there must be <strong>&ldquo;sufficient reason&rdquo;</strong> for the deprivation or else it would be arbitrary, and the greater the deprivation the more compelling the reason for such deprivation must be. The Court reasoned that the requirement served the important purpose of encouraging payment and considering the various categories of occupiers, the owner is usually in a position to take reasonable steps to prevent the unreasonable accumulation of outstanding consumption charges. It was therefore reasonable for the owner to bear this risk. Even in the case of unlawful occupiers, the owner is in the position to take reasonable steps to ensure it is not unlawfully occupied, by securing the property and instituting eviction proceedings to ensure such occupiers do not remain on the property for long. The deprivation in question related to one element of ownership (the right to alienate property). The Court emphasised that this was not an insubstantial deprivation as the provision requires the owner of the property to bear the risk of non-payment of consumption charges by non-owner occupiers. The Court stated that the relationship between the owner, the property and the consumption charge was sufficiently close to require the owner to bear the risk of non-payment and <strong>section 118(1)</strong> was not found to be arbitrary, Similarly, in cases of unlawful occupation the burden placed on the owner was held not to render <strong>section 118(1)</strong> arbitrary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court also held that that procedural fairness necessitates that all municipalities must, on the written request of owners, provide owners with copies of electricity and water accounts sent to occupiers.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>One of the core issues the Constitutional Court had to determine was whether <strong>section 118(1)</strong> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> and <strong>section 50(1)(a)</strong> of the <em>Ordinance</em> were consistent with <strong>section 25 of the Constitution</strong>.

These factors are not a closed list. On considering these factors, the Court held that gay people were a vulnerable minority group in society. The Court also emphasized that &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo; as referred to in <strong>section 9(3)</strong> must be given a wide interpretation. Sodomy laws criminalised gay men&rsquo;s intimate, private relationships and this degraded them and was held to constitute a limitation of their fundamental rights to dignity and privacy. On the right to privacy, the Court explained that this constitutional right allows people to enjoy a degree of private intimacy and autonomy free from outside interference and that giving expression to sexuality is at the heart of this private intimacy. Any intrusion upon consensual acts which cause no harm within this sphere breaches the right to privacy. The fact that both the rights to equality and privacy were breached emphasized how severely the rights of gay persons had been violated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court then turned to <strong>section 36(1)</strong> to determine whether this limitation could be upheld as a justifiable limitation.

The occupiers indicated that they were willing to leave the property if given reasonable notice and provided suitable alternative land to which they could move. The occupiers were told they could move to a place referred to as Walmer Township (Walmer), however they rejected the proposal saying the area was crime-ridden and over-crowded and further that they feared they would have no security of occupation there and find themselves liable to further eviction. The municipality argued that if alternative land was made available to them, they would be disrupting the housing programme and forcing the municipality to grant them preferential treatment. The Municipality applied to the South Eastern Cape Local Division of the High Court for an eviction order against the occupiers and the Court ordered the occupiers to vacate the land and authorised the Sheriff to demolish the structures. The occupiers then appealed the High Court&rsquo;s order to the SCA. The SCA held that the availability of alternative land was a key factor in the matter and considering that it was unclear whether Walmer was owned by the State or privately, the High Court should not have made this order without confirming whether there would be security of tenure for the occupiers when relocated.</p>", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2004/7/eng@2004-10-01", "id": "PortElizabethMunicipalityvVariousOccupiersZACCSACCBCLRCC", "interpretation": "<div>\r\n<p>In a unanimous judgment by Sachs J, the court held that when dealing with constitutionally protected rights, it is important to uphold the values of human dignity, equality and freedom. One of the provisions of the Bill of Rights that has to be interpreted with these values in mind, is <strong>section 25</strong>, which provides the right to property. This matter accordingly turned on determining the constitutional relationship between <strong>section 25</strong> and <strong>section 26</strong>. Sections 25 and 26 create an overlap between land rights and socio-economic rights and it is the duty of the state to fulfil both rights. The court held that the provisions of <strong>section 25, subsections 4-9</strong> must be borne in mind whenever <strong>section 25</strong> was being construed; this is because under the Constitution, the protection of property as an individual right was not absolute but subject to societal considerations. The Court also held that the state has a duty to satisfy both property and housing rights provided for in <strong>sections 25 and 26 of the Constitution and must seek to balance these rights</strong> Section 26(3) of the Constitution demonstrates special constitutional consideration for a person&rsquo;s home and acknowledges that a home is more than just a shelter from the elements, but is also an area of personal intimacy and family security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court furthermore held that the <em>Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act 19 of 1998 (PIE)</em> cannot simply be looked at as a legislative mechanism to re-establish common law property rights. The first part of the title of PIE emphasised a shift in focus from preventing illegal squatting to preventing illegal evictions. Under PIE squatting was decriminalised and evictions were subject to requirements in line with the Bill of Rights. The provisions of PIE must be considered against the values of South Africa&rsquo;s new constitutional dispensation. In making its decision, the court must consider all relevant circumstances, including the manner in which occupation was effected, its duration and the availability of suitable alternative accommodation or land, the motivation for settling on land, the degree of desperation of people who have sought land, and whether people occupied land with a plausible belief that they have permission to be there (as opposed to those who deliberately invade land to deliberately disrupt the organised housing programme and place themselves at the front of the queue). Regarding suitable alternative accommodation, the Court emphasised that this will vary from municipality to municipality and depends on the number of people facing eviction in each case and whether the municipality is able to secure suitable accommodation for unlawful occupiers without prejudicing the claims of lawful occupiers and those in line for formal housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court held that considering the period which the occupiers have lived on the land, the fact that eviction is not necessary for the land to be used productively and that this is a relatively small group of people who appear to be genuinely homeless and in need, it would not be just and equitable to order the eviction.

These powers did not derive their authority from any legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These powers were not legislative or judicial. Therefore, they are executive in nature as there is no fourth branch of government. This was supported by <strong>section 83</strong> of the Interim Constitution which refers to section 82 powers as &ldquo;executive acts&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, when the President exercises constitutional powers in terms of section 82(1) of the Interim Constitution, he acts as an executive organ of government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since all organs of state are subject to the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, all exercises of presidential power are subject to the provisions of the Interim Constitution, which include the Bill of Rights. Therefore, the President&rsquo;s exercise of constitutionally derived powers can be reviewed by courts of law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court found that the powers afforded to the President under <strong>section 82</strong> could be exercised without the approval of the Cabinet but the President needed to consult with the Executive Deputy Presidents (as per section 82(1) of the Interim Constitution) before exercising this power. The President was not however bound by their views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court added that the section 82(1) of the Interim Constitution placed specific matters within the power of the President. It emphasised that this did not mean that if a President were to abuse this power vested in him or her under section 82(1)(k) a court would be powerless, for it was implicit in the Interim Constitution that the President will exercise that power in good faith. If, for instance, a President were to abuse his or her powers by acting in bad faith the Court saw no reason why a court should not intervene to correct such action and to declare it to be unconstitutional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Respondent sought to review the exercise of the President&rsquo;s power on the basis that it violated the Bill of Rights by unfairly discriminating against him on the basis of sex or gender. The Court held that the pardoning of certain mothers with children under the age of 12 targeted a particular group of prisoners and was therefore discriminatory on the combined basis of sex and parenthood of children below the age of 12. A finding that discrimination occurred is not the end of the inquiry as the Interim Constitution only prohibits discrimaintion that is unfair. To determine whether the discrimination was unfair the Court looked at the impact of the discrimination. According to the Court, the impact on fathers of young children who were not released was found not to significantly compromise the dignity and worth of the men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the pardon did not discriminate unfairly because the discretion to pardon was with the applicant and the pardon did not prevent fathers from directly applying to the applicant to be pardoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court concluded that the President had exercised his discretion fairly and in a manner that was consistent with the Interim Constitution.

The applicants&rsquo; argued that it was not rational for a convener of a gathering to take all reasonable steps to prevent an act or omission even if that act or omission was not reasonably foreseeable. Mogoeng CJ, considered the meaning of the provision and held that there is a connection between the steps that a convener takes, within its power, and preventing harm that is reasonably foreseeable. If appropriate steps are adopted when planning a gathering and these steps are reasonable to prevent foreseeable outcomes, the taking of such steps would render any act or omission that resulted in riot damage to be classified as reasonably unforeseeable. The defence was therefore found to be rational.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mogoeng CJ, then turned to considered whether the provision limited section 17 of the Constitution. Mogoeng J held that section 11(2) of the Regulation of Gatherings Act does limit section 17 of the Constitution as it requires conveners of gatherings to adhere to the requirements and can potentially increase the cost of organising a protest which could bar under-resourced organisations from being able to protest. The question was whether this limitation could be justified in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution as a reasonable and justifiable limitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On conducting the limitation analysis in terms of section 36 of the Constitution, and looking at the importance of the right to assemble, the Court emphasised that the right to freedom of assembly is central to our constitutional democracy. It exists to give a voice to less powerful people in society and groups that do not wield political or economic power and other vulnerable persons. The right may be the only mechanism for such persons to express their concerns. Bearing in mind the significance of this right, the purpose of the limitation must be important enough to justify the limitation. The Court held that the purpose of the limitation, to protect individuals, especially those who themselves are under-resourced, who suffer damages caused by protests, is a crucial one. The Court reasoned that the public has no means to control protests whereas organisers are in a position to control and manage protests. Organizations have a choice between exercising the right to assemble or abandoning protests in order to prevent reasonably foreseeable damage. Conversely, victims of riot damage have no choice regarding what may happen to them or their property. Therefore, the Court held that the justification provided for by the law was viable and that the limitation on the right to freedom of assembly in <strong>section 17 of the Constitution</strong> was held to be reasonable and justifiable. The Court emphasized that the Regulation of Gatherings Act does not nullify the right to freedom of assembly, but imposes strict conditions on the right in order to prevent injury to persons or property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a concurring judgment, Jafta J held that the appeal should be dismissed, on the basis that the applicants had failed to prove that section 11(2) of the Regulations of Gatherings Act limited the right to freedom of assembly.

Section 26(1) of the Interim Constitution guaranteed every person &ldquo;the right to freely engage in economic activity and to pursue a livelihood in the national territory&rdquo;. Section 26(2) held that this does not preclude the designing of measures &ldquo;to promote the protection or the improvement of the quality of life, economic growth, human development, social justice, basic conditions of employment, fair labour practices or equal opportunity for all, provided such measures are justifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court emphasised that section 26(2) requires there to be a rational connection between the law and the purpose for which it was enacted and if the purpose is sanctioned by subsection 2, the second question is whether it is justifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality. In this matter the Court held that the legislature was mandated to &ldquo;combat social ills&rdquo; and the means chosen to regulate this fell within the scope of Parliament. Parliament had a wide discretion in choosing how to combat social problems, including through the creation of new offences. Furthermore, the courts must give effect to legislative choices made by Parliament except where the choices are not in line with the Constitution. The Court emphasised that it cannot declare legislation invalid merely because it views it as ineffective or because there were better means of addressing the problem. The majority held that sex work and brothel keeping were not protected by section 26 of the Interim Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minority judgment by O&rsquo;Regan J and Sachs J, acknowledged that the challenges to section 26 of the Interim Constitution provides two possible interpretations. One interpretation is that it only relates to lawful economic activity; the other is that it relates to all forms of economic activity. However, the minority recognised that the question whether the right could be claimed only if it related to lawful economic activity did not need to be resolved at this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In relation to the other constitutional challenges raised, the majority and minority judgments agreed that the appeal against the High Court&rsquo;s order concerning brothels should be dismissed. The majority held that section 20(1)(aA) was not unconstitutional and did not confirm the High Court&rsquo;s order of constitutional invalidity and that sex work did not unfairly discriminate on the basis of gender. The minority agreed that criminalisation of sex work did not infringe the rights to human dignity and economic activity, and that any limitation on privacy was reasonably justifiable. However, the minority judgement found that the criminalisation of sex work reinforces double standards and gender stereotypes by making patrons accomplices to the crime at most and in contrast, making the sex worker the primary offender and this constituted unfair discrimination</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<div>\r\n<p>Various constitutional challenges were raised against the Sexual Offences Act.

First, it is as a guiding principle in each case that deals with a particular child. Secondly, it is a standard against which to test provisions or conduct which affect children in general. The Court added that the best-interests principle is not only limited to scenarios where legislation is inflexible, the principle also applies in circumstances where a statutory provision is shown to be against the best interests of children in general, for whatever reason. As a matter of logic what is bad for all children will be bad for one child in a particular case. Thus, if there is evidence that exposing children to the criminal justice system for engaging in consensual sexual behaviour has a negative impact on them generally, then a Court may declare the scheme to be contrary to the best interests of the child in terms of section 28(2), and therefore invalid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, <strong>section 28</strong> is both a self-standing right and a guiding principle in respect of all matters affecting the child. What is in the best interests of the child in each case will require a consideration of various factors. Further, it is not necessary that the specific interests of the child in the case before the court are affected, but rather whether the interests of children in general are affected. Legislation would be inconsistent with this right if it is demonstrated to be against the interests of children in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court found that sections 15 and 16 of the Act were unconstitutional in that they infringed the rights of adolescents (12- to 16-year olds) to dignity and privacy, and further in that they violated the best-interests principle contained in <strong>section 28(2) of the Constitution</strong>. The Court held that the sections infringed the best-interests principle in many ways. Most importantly, the offences created by the provisions ran the risk of exposing children to the harmful effects of the criminal justice system and could undermine support structures by deterring adolescents from seeking help and could create a breakdown in parental care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relying on expert evidence, the Court concluded that the provisions criminalized what constituted developmentally normal conduct for adolescents, and adversely affected the very children the Act sought to protect. The effects of the provisions were found not to be rationally related to the State&rsquo;s purpose of protecting children. The Court then found that the infringement of the best-interests principle cannot be justified in terms of section 36 of the Constitution as was no evidence that criminalising such consensual sexual behaviour would deter adolescents from engaging in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the Constitutional Court declared the sections 15 and 16 of the Act invalid to the extent that they criminalized consensual sexual conduct between adolescents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Constitutional Court suspended the declaration of invalidity for 18 months to allow Parliament to amend the provisions. The Court further ordered a suspension on all investigations, arrests, prosecutions and criminal and ancillary proceedings (regarding adolescents) in relation to sections 15 and 16 of the Act, until Parliament remedied the defects identified. Finally, the Minister was ordered to take the necessary steps to ensure that the details of any adolescent convicted of an offence in terms of sections 15 or 16 of the Act will not appear in the National Register for Sex Offenders and that such an adolescent will have his or her criminal record removed.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The applicants argued at the Constitutional Court that sections 15 and 16 of the Act unjustifiably infringe children&rsquo;s constitutional rights to dignity, privacy and bodily and psychological integrity, as well as the principle in section 28(2) of the Constitution that a child&#39;s best interests must be of paramount importance in all matters concerning the child.

In a country where xenophobia has caused increased suffering, it was important to stress this and explain that it was not that the Authority did not trust refugees. The Security Act was designed to limit eligibility for registration to people whose trustworthiness could be objectively verified, and it was easier to verify the trustworthiness of citizens and permanent residents. The preamble to the Act acknowledges that the right to security of the person is fundamental to the well-being and to the social and economic development of every person. The Court therefore held that the differentiation between citizens and permanent residents on one hand and other foreigners in this instance, was rational and served a legitimate government purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On establishing differentiation, the majority judgment then considered whether the differentiation amounted to discrimination. The Court held that in this instance, the differentiation was on grounds analogous to those listed in section 9(3) of the Constitution, and therefore constituted discrimination. The analysis then turned to whether the discrimination was unfair. Various factors were considered by the Court on the question of fairness, such as the fact that while refugees were fully entitled to work in South Africa, <strong>section 22 of the Constitution</strong> limited the right to choose a job to citizens only. The Court also considered that refugees could be registered as security service providers if the requirements of section 23(6) of the Security Act were met and that there was no complete exclusion of refugees from being registered. The majority found that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act did not unfairly discriminate against the applicants and was therefore constitutionally sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their dissenting judgment, Mokgoro J and O&#39;Regan J held that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act discriminated unfairly on the basis of refugee status. The joint dissenting judgment was not convinced that the purpose identified by the Minister to ensure that security service employees were trustworthy was really intended by the section. The dissenting judgment stated that the order it would have proposed was to require that refugees who could meet the other requirements of the Security Act should not be barred from registration as security service providers. Those refugees who could not meet those requirements should seek to establish that &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; exists for them to be registered as contemplated by section 23(6) of the Security Act.</p>\r\n</div>", "right_and_principle": "<div>\r\n<p>The applicants applied to the High Court to review and set aside the decisions of the Authority and the Appeal Committee and in the alternative they sought to declare section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act inconsistent with the Constitution on the basis that it violated the right to equality in section 9 of the Constitution as it unfairly discriminated against the applicants due to their refugee status.

However, there was relic law from the apartheid era, Proclamation R293 of 1962, issued in terms of the Administration Act of 1927. This Proclamation governed the setting-up of special African townships by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in areas under the African Native Trust. This Proclamation was one of the tools with which the apartheid state disposed Africans from landholding and created barriers to Africans owning any land. Instead, Africans could only hold rights to the lands through an insecure tenure system of Deeds of Grant and Certificates of Occupancy and letting for residential purposes. The township manager had the authority to cancel this tenure at any point. Special deeds registries were created to register the deeds of grant under the legislation.</p>\n<p>When South Africa transitioned to democratic majority rule, the President, empowered by the Interim Constitution, passed Proclamation R9 of 1997 together with amendments to the Deeds Registry Act.

Different Bills will go through different routes, depending on where they originated, what they seek to do, and whether or not they affect the provinces. These processes are further expanded and dealt with by the <strong>Rules of the National Assembly</strong> and the <strong>Rules of the National Council of Provinces</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 73</strong> of the Constitution dictates who can introduce any Bill in the National Assembly (NA) and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). It states that only a Cabinet member, a Deputy Minister, or a member or committee of the National Assembly, can introduce a Bill in the National Assembly. Only the Cabinet member responsible for national financial matters may introduce either a Money Bill or a Bill which provides for legislation expected in <strong>section 214 of the Constitution</strong> (equitable shares and allocations of revenue). Only a member or committee of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) may introduce a Bill in the Council referred to in <strong>section 76(3)</strong>, besides the Bills that may be introduced in the NA. If there is a need, a Bill passed by the NA must be referred to the NCOP. A Bill passed by the Council must be referred to the NA.<br><br><strong>Section 74</strong> sets out the process for amending the Constitution. The process is rigorous, which reflects the seriousness of constitutional changes. It states that any Bill amending <strong>s\u00a01 of the Constitution</strong>, or <strong>s 74</strong>, can only be passed by the NA and the NCOP together, with a supporting vote of at least 75 per cent of NA members and a supporting vote of at least six provinces in the NCOP. A Bill amending any provision in Ch 2 (the Bill of Rights) requires a supporting vote of at least two-thirds of NA members and a supporting vote of at least six provinces in the NCOP. Any Bill amending the Constitution must also be referred to the President for assent.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 75 of the Constitution</strong> sets out the procedure to be followed by the NCOP after the NA passes Ordinary Bills not affecting provinces. On receipt of such a bill, the NCOP must deal with the Bill in one of three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>pass the Bill without amendments and submit it for presidential assent; or</li>\n<li>pass the Bill subject to amendments, which requires the NA to reconsider the Bill and pass the Bill again with or without amendments and submit it for presidential assent; or decide not to proceed with the Bill; or</li>\n<li>reject the Bill.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Section 76</strong> covers the procedure for when the NA passes an ordinary bill affecting provinces, other than a money bill. Such a Bill must be reported to the NCOP, which must then pass the Bill, pass an amended Bill, or reject the Bill. If the NCOP passes the Bill without amendment, the Bill must be sent to the President for assent. If the NCOP amends the bill, the bill must be sent to the NA and if the NA passes the amended Bill, it is sent to the President for assent. If the NCOP rejects the Bill, or if the NA refuses to pass an amended Bill, the Bill or the amended Bill must be referred to the Mediation Committee.\u00a0<br><br>The Mediation Committee may agree on the Bill as passed by the NA, the amended Bill as passed by the NCOP, or a different version of the Bill. <strong>Section 78</strong> deals with the Mediation Committee, who may be part of the Committee and how it can agree on a version of a Bill or decide on a question during the national legislative process. The Mediation Committee consists of nine members of the NA, elected by the Assembly, and one delegate from each provincial delegation in the NCOP. The Committee will only have officially agreed on a Bill or a question if the Bill, or one side of the question, is supported by at least five of the representatives of the NA and at least five of the representatives of the NCOP. The mediation must be completed within 30 days and if the two houses still disagree after mediation, the original bill lapses. The bill may, however, still become law if it is passed again by two-thirds of the NA. This requirement prevents the NCOP from having absolute power over such bills, but it means that the NCOP can delay the passage of the bills and force a two-thirds majority in the NA for the bill to be passed.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Section 77 </strong>deals with so-called \u2018money bills\u2019, which is any bill that appropriates money; imposes national taxes, levies, duties or surcharges; abolishes or reduces any national taxes, levies, duties or surcharges; or authorises direct charges against the National Revenue Fund. These Bills can only deal with these issues or subordinate matters incidental to them. Money bills are dealt with in the same way as ordinary bills not affecting the provinces.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 79 of the Constitution</strong> concerns what the President can do with new Bills. The President can either assent (agree) to the new Bill and sign it, or refer it back to the NA for reconsideration if he/she has reservations about the constitutionality. If the Bill referred to the NA included matters that relate to the NCOP, then the NCOP must participate in the reconsideration of the Bill. Once the Bill is reconsidered and sent back to the President, he/she can either assent to and sign it or, if he/she still has reservations about it, send it to the Constitutional Court for a decision on its constitutionality. If the Constitutional Court decides that the Bill is constitutional, then the President must assent to and sign it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sections 80 and 81</strong> state that when a Bill is assented to and signed by the President, it becomes an Act of Parliament. It must then be published promptly and takes effect when it is published in the Government Gazette. The signed copy of the Act is conclusive evidence of the provisions of that Act and must be kept at the Constitutional Court.</p>\n<p>If an Act is passed and members of the NA are concerned about its constitutionality, <strong>s 82</strong> provides that they may apply to the Constitutional Court for an order declaring that all or part of it is unconstitutional. However, such an application must be supported by at least one-third of NA members and must be made within 30 days of the President assenting to and signing the Act.</p></div>"}], "en": [{"cases": ["EconomicFreedomFightersvGordhanandOthersPublicProtectorandAnothervGordhanandOthersZACCBCLRCC", "EconomicFreedomFightersvSpeakeroftheNationalAssemblyandOthersDemocraticAlliancevSpeakeroftheNationalAssemblyandOthersZACCBCLRCCSACC", "PublicProtectorvSouthAfricanReserveBankZACCBCLRCCSACC"], "date_updated": "2024-04-11T07:35:15.949452+00:00", "id": "Chapter_9_Institutions", "interpretation": "<div><p>These institutions in terms of section 181 of the Constitution are independent and are \u201csubject only to the Constitution and the law\u201d.

On receipt of such a bill, the NCOP must deal with the Bill in one of three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>pass the Bill without amendments and submit it for presidential assent; or</li>\n<li>pass the Bill subject to amendments, which requires the NA to reconsider the Bill and pass the Bill again with or without amendments and submit it for presidential assent; or decide not to proceed with the Bill; or</li>\n<li>reject the Bill.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Section 76</strong> covers the procedure for when the NA passes an ordinary bill affecting provinces, other than a money bill. Such a Bill must be reported to the NCOP, which must then pass the Bill, pass an amended Bill, or reject the Bill. If the NCOP passes the Bill without amendment, the Bill must be sent to the President for assent. If the NCOP amends the bill, the bill must be sent to the NA and if the NA passes the amended Bill, it is sent to the President for assent. If the NCOP rejects the Bill, or if the NA refuses to pass an amended Bill, the Bill or the amended Bill must be referred to the Mediation Committee.\u00a0<br><br>The Mediation Committee may agree on the Bill as passed by the NA, the amended Bill as passed by the NCOP, or a different version of the Bill. <strong>Section 78</strong> deals with the Mediation Committee, who may be part of the Committee and how it can agree on a version of a Bill or decide on a question during the national legislative process. The Mediation Committee consists of nine members of the NA, elected by the Assembly, and one delegate from each provincial delegation in the NCOP. The Committee will only have officially agreed on a Bill or a question if the Bill, or one side of the question, is supported by at least five of the representatives of the NA and at least five of the representatives of the NCOP. The mediation must be completed within 30 days and if the two houses still disagree after mediation, the original bill lapses. The bill may, however, still become law if it is passed again by two-thirds of the NA. This requirement prevents the NCOP from having absolute power over such bills, but it means that the NCOP can delay the passage of the bills and force a two-thirds majority in the NA for the bill to be passed.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Section 77 </strong>deals with so-called \u2018money bills\u2019, which is any bill that appropriates money; imposes national taxes, levies, duties or surcharges; abolishes or reduces any national taxes, levies, duties or surcharges; or authorises direct charges against the National Revenue Fund. These Bills can only deal with these issues or subordinate matters incidental to them. Money bills are dealt with in the same way as ordinary bills not affecting the provinces.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 79 of the Constitution</strong> concerns what the President can do with new Bills. The President can either assent (agree) to the new Bill and sign it, or refer it back to the NA for reconsideration if he/she has reservations about the constitutionality. If the Bill referred to the NA included matters that relate to the NCOP, then the NCOP must participate in the reconsideration of the Bill. Once the Bill is reconsidered and sent back to the President, he/she can either assent to and sign it or, if he/she still has reservations about it, send it to the Constitutional Court for a decision on its constitutionality. If the Constitutional Court decides that the Bill is constitutional, then the President must assent to and sign it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sections 80 and 81</strong> state that when a Bill is assented to and signed by the President, it becomes an Act of Parliament. It must then be published promptly and takes effect when it is published in the Government Gazette. The signed copy of the Act is conclusive evidence of the provisions of that Act and must be kept at the Constitutional Court.</p>\n<p>If an Act is passed and members of the NA are concerned about its constitutionality, <strong>s 82</strong> provides that they may apply to the Constitutional Court for an order declaring that all or part of it is unconstitutional. However, such an application must be supported by at least one-third of NA members and must be made within 30 days of the President assenting to and signing the Act.</p></div>"}], "xh": [{"cases": ["EconomicFreedomFightersvGordhanandOthersPublicProtectorandAnothervGordhanandOthersZACCBCLRCC", "EconomicFreedomFightersvSpeakeroftheNationalAssemblyandOthersDemocraticAlliancevSpeakeroftheNationalAssemblyandOthersZACCBCLRCCSACC", "PublicProtectorvSouthAfricanReserveBankZACCBCLRCCSACC"], "date_updated": "2024-04-11T07:35:15.949452+00:00", "id": "Chapter_9_Institutions", "interpretation": "<div><p>These institutions in terms of section 181 of the Constitution are independent and are \u201csubject only to the Constitution and the law\u201d.

Like the members of the National Assembly, NCOP members have parliamentary privileges and immunities (<strong>s 71</strong>), which means that an NCOP member has free speech and can't be held civilly or criminally liable for what they say or produce before the NCOP or its committees. The NCOP also has important obligations, however, which include the duty to facilitate public participation in its processes and to conduct its business in an open and transparent way (<strong>s 72</strong>).</p></div>"}, {"cases": ["DoctorsforLifeInternationalvSpeakeroftheNationalAssemblyandOthers(CCT12/05)[2006]ZACC11", "ExPartePresidentoftheRepublicofSouthAfricaInreConstitutionalityoftheLiquorBillZACCSABCLR", "TongoaneandOthersvNationalMinisterforAgricultureandLandAffairsandOthers(CCT100of2009)[2010]ZACC10"], "date_updated": "2024-04-11T07:35:15.799085+00:00", "id": "The_National_Legislative_Process", "interpretation": "<p>In <em>Doctors for Life International v Speaker of the House of Assembly,</em> the Constitutional Court cites <strong>Section 73</strong> as part of the \u201cNational Legislative Process\u201d in which \u201call Bills, constitutional amendments, Bills affecting and not affecting provinces and money Bills are dealt with, together with assent to Bills and the publication and safekeeping of Acts.\u201d<br>In <em>Ex Parte President of the Republic of South Africa: In re Constitutionality of the Liquor Bill</em>, the Constitutional Court interpreted <strong>section 76</strong> of the Constitution as placing more influence on the National Council of Provinces, mainly though invoking the Mediation Committee.

Different Bills will go through different routes, depending on where they originated, what they seek to do, and whether or not they affect the provinces. These processes are further expanded and dealt with by the <strong>Rules of the National Assembly</strong> and the <strong>Rules of the National Council of Provinces</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 73</strong> of the Constitution dictates who can introduce any Bill in the National Assembly (NA) and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). It states that only a Cabinet member, a Deputy Minister, or a member or committee of the National Assembly, can introduce a Bill in the National Assembly. Only the Cabinet member responsible for national financial matters may introduce either a Money Bill or a Bill which provides for legislation expected in <strong>section 214 of the Constitution</strong> (equitable shares and allocations of revenue). Only a member or committee of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) may introduce a Bill in the Council referred to in <strong>section 76(3)</strong>, besides the Bills that may be introduced in the NA. If there is a need, a Bill passed by the NA must be referred to the NCOP. A Bill passed by the Council must be referred to the NA.<br><br><strong>Section 74</strong> sets out the process for amending the Constitution. The process is rigorous, which reflects the seriousness of constitutional changes. It states that any Bill amending <strong>s\u00a01 of the Constitution</strong>, or <strong>s 74</strong>, can only be passed by the NA and the NCOP together, with a supporting vote of at least 75 per cent of NA members and a supporting vote of at least six provinces in the NCOP. A Bill amending any provision in Ch 2 (the Bill of Rights) requires a supporting vote of at least two-thirds of NA members and a supporting vote of at least six provinces in the NCOP. Any Bill amending the Constitution must also be referred to the President for assent.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 75 of the Constitution</strong> sets out the procedure to be followed by the NCOP after the NA passes Ordinary Bills not affecting provinces. On receipt of such a bill, the NCOP must deal with the Bill in one of three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>pass the Bill without amendments and submit it for presidential assent; or</li>\n<li>pass the Bill subject to amendments, which requires the NA to reconsider the Bill and pass the Bill again with or without amendments and submit it for presidential assent; or decide not to proceed with the Bill; or</li>\n<li>reject the Bill.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Section 76</strong> covers the procedure for when the NA passes an ordinary bill affecting provinces, other than a money bill. Such a Bill must be reported to the NCOP, which must then pass the Bill, pass an amended Bill, or reject the Bill. If the NCOP passes the Bill without amendment, the Bill must be sent to the President for assent. If the NCOP amends the bill, the bill must be sent to the NA and if the NA passes the amended Bill, it is sent to the President for assent. If the NCOP rejects the Bill, or if the NA refuses to pass an amended Bill, the Bill or the amended Bill must be referred to the Mediation Committee.\u00a0<br><br>The Mediation Committee may agree on the Bill as passed by the NA, the amended Bill as passed by the NCOP, or a different version of the Bill. <strong>Section 78</strong> deals with the Mediation Committee, who may be part of the Committee and how it can agree on a version of a Bill or decide on a question during the national legislative process. The Mediation Committee consists of nine members of the NA, elected by the Assembly, and one delegate from each provincial delegation in the NCOP. The Committee will only have officially agreed on a Bill or a question if the Bill, or one side of the question, is supported by at least five of the representatives of the NA and at least five of the representatives of the NCOP. The mediation must be completed within 30 days and if the two houses still disagree after mediation, the original bill lapses. The bill may, however, still become law if it is passed again by two-thirds of the NA. This requirement prevents the NCOP from having absolute power over such bills, but it means that the NCOP can delay the passage of the bills and force a two-thirds majority in the NA for the bill to be passed.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Section 77 </strong>deals with so-called \u2018money bills\u2019, which is any bill that appropriates money; imposes national taxes, levies, duties or surcharges; abolishes or reduces any national taxes, levies, duties or surcharges; or authorises direct charges against the National Revenue Fund. These Bills can only deal with these issues or subordinate matters incidental to them. Money bills are dealt with in the same way as ordinary bills not affecting the provinces.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 79 of the Constitution</strong> concerns what the President can do with new Bills. The President can either assent (agree) to the new Bill and sign it, or refer it back to the NA for reconsideration if he/she has reservations about the constitutionality. If the Bill referred to the NA included matters that relate to the NCOP, then the NCOP must participate in the reconsideration of the Bill. Once the Bill is reconsidered and sent back to the President, he/she can either assent to and sign it or, if he/she still has reservations about it, send it to the Constitutional Court for a decision on its constitutionality. If the Constitutional Court decides that the Bill is constitutional, then the President must assent to and sign it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sections 80 and 81</strong> state that when a Bill is assented to and signed by the President, it becomes an Act of Parliament. It must then be published promptly and takes effect when it is published in the Government Gazette. The signed copy of the Act is conclusive evidence of the provisions of that Act and must be kept at the Constitutional Court.</p>\n<p>If an Act is passed and members of the NA are concerned about its constitutionality, <strong>s 82</strong> provides that they may apply to the Constitutional Court for an order declaring that all or part of it is unconstitutional. However, such an application must be supported by at least one-third of NA members and must be made within 30 days of the President assenting to and signing the Act.</p></div>"}], "zu": [{"cases": ["EconomicFreedomFightersvGordhanandOthersPublicProtectorandAnothervGordhanandOthersZACCBCLRCC", "EconomicFreedomFightersvSpeakeroftheNationalAssemblyandOthersDemocraticAlliancevSpeakeroftheNationalAssemblyandOthersZACCBCLRCCSACC", "PublicProtectorvSouthAfricanReserveBankZACCBCLRCCSACC"], "date_updated": "2024-04-11T07:35:15.949452+00:00", "id": "Chapter_9_Institutions", "interpretation": "<div><p>These institutions in terms of section 181 of the Constitution are independent and are \u201csubject only to the Constitution and the law\u201d.

Different Bills will go through different routes, depending on where they originated, what they seek to do, and whether or not they affect the provinces.

It states that only a Cabinet member, a Deputy Minister, or a member or committee of the National Assembly, can introduce a Bill in the National Assembly. Only the Cabinet member responsible for national financial matters may introduce either a Money Bill or a Bill which provides for legislation expected in <strong>section 214 of the Constitution</strong> (equitable shares and allocations of revenue). Only a member or committee of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) may introduce a Bill in the Council referred to in <strong>section 76(3)</strong>, besides the Bills that may be introduced in the NA. If there is a need, a Bill passed by the NA must be referred to the NCOP. A Bill passed by the Council must be referred to the NA.<br><br><strong>Section 74</strong> sets out the process for amending the Constitution. The process is rigorous, which reflects the seriousness of constitutional changes. It states that any Bill amending <strong>s\u00a01 of the Constitution</strong>, or <strong>s 74</strong>, can only be passed by the NA and the NCOP together, with a supporting vote of at least 75 per cent of NA members and a supporting vote of at least six provinces in the NCOP. A Bill amending any provision in Ch 2 (the Bill of Rights) requires a supporting vote of at least two-thirds of NA members and a supporting vote of at least six provinces in the NCOP. Any Bill amending the Constitution must also be referred to the President for assent.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 75 of the Constitution</strong> sets out the procedure to be followed by the NCOP after the NA passes Ordinary Bills not affecting provinces. On receipt of such a bill, the NCOP must deal with the Bill in one of three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>pass the Bill without amendments and submit it for presidential assent; or</li>\n<li>pass the Bill subject to amendments, which requires the NA to reconsider the Bill and pass the Bill again with or without amendments and submit it for presidential assent; or decide not to proceed with the Bill; or</li>\n<li>reject the Bill.\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Section 76</strong> covers the procedure for when the NA passes an ordinary bill affecting provinces, other than a money bill. Such a Bill must be reported to the NCOP, which must then pass the Bill, pass an amended Bill, or reject the Bill. If the NCOP passes the Bill without amendment, the Bill must be sent to the President for assent. If the NCOP amends the bill, the bill must be sent to the NA and if the NA passes the amended Bill, it is sent to the President for assent. If the NCOP rejects the Bill, or if the NA refuses to pass an amended Bill, the Bill or the amended Bill must be referred to the Mediation Committee.\u00a0<br><br>The Mediation Committee may agree on the Bill as passed by the NA, the amended Bill as passed by the NCOP, or a different version of the Bill. <strong>Section 78</strong> deals with the Mediation Committee, who may be part of the Committee and how it can agree on a version of a Bill or decide on a question during the national legislative process. The Mediation Committee consists of nine members of the NA, elected by the Assembly, and one delegate from each provincial delegation in the NCOP. The Committee will only have officially agreed on a Bill or a question if the Bill, or one side of the question, is supported by at least five of the representatives of the NA and at least five of the representatives of the NCOP. The mediation must be completed within 30 days and if the two houses still disagree after mediation, the original bill lapses. The bill may, however, still become law if it is passed again by two-thirds of the NA. This requirement prevents the NCOP from having absolute power over such bills, but it means that the NCOP can delay the passage of the bills and force a two-thirds majority in the NA for the bill to be passed.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Section 77 </strong>deals with so-called \u2018money bills\u2019, which is any bill that appropriates money; imposes national taxes, levies, duties or surcharges; abolishes or reduces any national taxes, levies, duties or surcharges; or authorises direct charges against the National Revenue Fund. These Bills can only deal with these issues or subordinate matters incidental to them. Money bills are dealt with in the same way as ordinary bills not affecting the provinces.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 79 of the Constitution</strong> concerns what the President can do with new Bills. The President can either assent (agree) to the new Bill and sign it, or refer it back to the NA for reconsideration if he/she has reservations about the constitutionality. If the Bill referred to the NA included matters that relate to the NCOP, then the NCOP must participate in the reconsideration of the Bill. Once the Bill is reconsidered and sent back to the President, he/she can either assent to and sign it or, if he/she still has reservations about it, send it to the Constitutional Court for a decision on its constitutionality. If the Constitutional Court decides that the Bill is constitutional, then the President must assent to and sign it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sections 80 and 81</strong> state that when a Bill is assented to and signed by the President, it becomes an Act of Parliament. It must then be published promptly and takes effect when it is published in the Government Gazette. The signed copy of the Act is conclusive evidence of the provisions of that Act and must be kept at the Constitutional Court.</p>\n<p>If an Act is passed and members of the NA are concerned about its constitutionality, <strong>s 82</strong> provides that they may apply to the Constitutional Court for an order declaring that all or part of it is unconstitutional. However, such an application must be supported by at least one-third of NA members and must be made within 30 days of the President assenting to and signing the Act.</p></div>"}]}}
