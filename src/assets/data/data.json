The Court held that section 8(2) makes it expressly clear that the rights contained in the Bill of Rights such as the right to basic education, can, depending on the nature of the right, be applied to bind private parties. Thus, section 8(2) imposes constitutional obligations on private entities, such as Pridwin. In subjecting power exercised by private (non-State) parties to constitutional control, section 8(2) recognises the importance of private interactions and their potential to violate human rights and to perpetuate inequality and disadvantage.\n\n</p><p>The Court then found that independent schools provide \u2018basic education\u2019, in terms of <b>section 29 of the Constitution</b>,  to learners as the nature of the entity providing education is not relevant to determining whether what is offered is \u201cbasic education\u201d. Therefore, section 29(1)(a) is an overarching right to basic education that applies to all persons and is enjoyed by children at public and independent schools alike.</p>\n\n<p>With respect to the second issue, the Court held that a decision to discontinue a learner\u2019s education would be unconstitutional and therefore invalid if the school did not give an opportunity to the learners or their parents/guardian or representatives to make representations before the decision was made by the school to terminate the parent contract and remove the child from the school. The Court held that this is premised on the fact that <b>section 29 of the Constitution</b> places an obligation on all schools, both private and government schools, to not impair or interfere with the right to basic education. In this case, the school was unable to demonstrate appropriate reasons for limiting the rights of the applicants to basic education without providing an opportunity to the applicants to make representations to the school before the decision to remove the children from the school had been taken. The Court therefore held that the <b>section 29</b> right was impaired due to the absence of a fair procedure being followed prior to the termination of the contract. Accordingly, it was declared that that the school had the obligation to consider the rights of the applicants\u2019 children to have their views heard on the matter and to offer this opportunity to them. Therefore, the existence and enforcement of the clause in the contract was found to be unconstitutional and invalid.</p>\n</div>", "snippet": "<p>The issue in this case was whether the clause in the contract between the parents and the school was a Constitutionally valid one as it did not afford the other party to the contract to state their case before the contract was terminated.

The Court held that any infringement of the right to strike was reasonable and justifiable based on the principle of majoritarianism. Majoritarianism is a policy choice which allows the will of the majority to prevail over that of the minority. The principle of majoritarianism, in this context, benefitted orderly collective bargaining. That majoritarianism was functional to enhance collective bargaining was internationally recognized.

In relation to the question whether section 23(1) of the Constitution was limited, the majority held that the Labour Relations Act gives effect to the right to fair labour practices and the Courts have consistently interpreted section 189 of the Labour Relation Act to exclude any need for individual and parallel consultation where a collective agreement exists. The right to individual consultation during the retrenchment process in these circumstances was found not to be supported by the Constitution nor the Labour Relations Act. The majority also held that the freedom of association challenge by the applicant failed as this would require the Court to adopt a proposition that the right to freely associate meant that every union must be treated equally, and enjoy all statutory entitlements, regardless of its size.

Jafta J further stated that there is  no justification for placing majoritarianism beyond the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

The Court held that the exclusion of child victims in section 154(3) limited the right to equality, as it constituted a one-sided differentiation that did not offer equal protection and benefit of the law.

The Court acknowledged the open justice principle and the importance of freedom of expression, however held that the default position of offering the child participants ongoing protection did not result in a severe disadvantage on media freedom.

The minority judgments held that the right to freedom of expression and the principle of open justice tipped the scales in favour of a default regime in which anonymity protection ended when a protected child reaches 18 years of age, unless a court expressly extends the protection. The dissenting judgments argued further that the conclusion that the rights to dignity, privacy and the best interests of the child were infringed was hard to understand in the context of the ongoing protection.

This could create an anomaly as persons who acquired citizenship by descent under the previous version of the Citizenship Act would now be excluded.

Citizenship related to the core of a person\u2019s identity, a sense of belonging in a community and to security of a person most especially in communities rife with xenophobia. Deprivation of, or interference with, a person\u2019s citizenship status affects their private and family life, their choices concerning where establish their homes, apply for jobs, enrol in schools; whether they can form part of the community; their ability to participate fully in the political activity and governance; and the extent to which they may exercise freedom of movement.</p>\n\n<p>(ii) The Constitutional Court held that whilst certain rights in the Constitution are only available to South African citizens, drawing arbitrary and irrational distinctions between citizens and non-citizens through legislation or decision-making is inconsistent with the Constitution. </p>\n\n<p>(iii) Legislation must be interpreted to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, but any interpretation must remain consistent with the text of the legislation.

The owner of the property (Blue Moonlight) approached the South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg seeking an order to evict the occupiers in order to develop the property. The occupiers opposed the eviction on the basis that it would almost certainly render them homeless and argued that the City of Johannesburg (the City)  had an obligation to provide them with temporary housing under the Constitution and the <b>Prevention of Illegal Eviction and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act, 19 of 1998 (PIE)</b> before they could be evicted.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>The High Court granted the eviction order, but also ordered the City to remedy its housing policy as it was found to be unconstitutional and the High Court issued a structural interdict against the City obliging the City to report back to the High Court on the steps taken remedying its housing policy.

The City argued that local government does not have a primary role in fulfilling the right to access to adequate housing and that this mandate falls on the shoulders of the national and provincial government. The City argued that it fulfilled its duties after requesting assistance from provincial government and no more could be expected from it. The occupiers opposed the City\u2019s appeal and also applied for a conditional cross-appeal requesting that an order of eviction be linked to the condition that suitable alternative accommodation be provided and that the City report back on steps taken to remedying its housing policy.</p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>In a unanimous judgment by Van der Westhuizen J, the Court held that an owner's constitutional right not to be deprived of property must be interpreted in the social and historical context and be balanced against the right of access to adequate housing and not to be evicted arbitrarily from one's home. The Court emphasised that apartheid legislation undermined both the right of access to adequate housing and the right to property. Section 25 prohibits arbitrary deprivation of property, but also undertakes to redress unequal social conditions.</p>  Section 26 of the Constitution \u201chighlights the transformative vision of the Constitution\u201d and PIE was enacted to specifically prevent the historical abuse of displacement of people. In this case, even though housing unlawful occupiers indefinitely suspends an owner's right to use and enjoy property, evictions can only be carried out in terms of PIE. PIE allows for the eviction of unlawful occupiers only in circumstances where such eviction is just and equitable.\r\n\r\n<p>In deciding whether an eviction is just and equitable in terms of PIE, the Court considered that many of the occupiers had lived on the property for a very long time, the occupation had once been lawful, Blue Moonlight was aware of the occupiers\u2019 presence when it purchased the property, and the eviction of the occupiers would render them homeless while there was no competing risk of homelessness on the part of Blue Moonlight. Furthermore, the Court held that a key consideration was whether the City had made reasonable efforts to provide alternative accommodation to the occupiers. After considering the City\u2019s housing policy, the Court noted that the policy differentiated between persons relocated by the City itself and those evicted by private landowners. However, where relocation was sought by the City, these persons were housed in temporary accommodation, which was not the case with persons evicted by private landowners.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Court emphasised that section 26(2) of the Constitution recognises that the state is constrained by resources in giving effect to the right to adequate housing and therefore a housing policy may differentiate and give preference to categories of people; however any differentiation must be rational. The City\u2019s housing policy was found to be \u201crigid\u201d. The Court held that the policy failed to take into account whether emergency accommodation should be made available in individual cases, considering the categories of persons affected (such as elderly people and children) and their circumstances, and that an imminent eviction might render them homeless, regardless of whether the eviction or relocation is sought by the City or a private landowner. The Court held that this differentiation was not rational. Where an eviction may result in homelessness, it is irrelevant whether such eviction is at the instance of the City or a private landowner. The Court emphasised that this matter concerns \u201ctemporary\u201d accommodation in an emergency as defined in Chapter 12 of the National Housing Code and not \u201cpermanent\u201d housing. The obligation, while derived from the right to progressive realisation of adequate housing in terms of <b>section 26(2) of the Constitution</b>, is distinct from the obligation to address permanent housing needs.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Court therefore declared the City\u2019s housing policy unconstitutional and in violation of section 26 of the Constitution to the extent that it excluded people evicted by private landowners from its temporary housing programme. The Court dismissed the City\u2019s appeal and held that the occupiers had to vacate the properties by a given date. The Court stipulated that the City was to provide the evictees with \"temporary accommodation in a location as near as feasibly possible to the area\" in which the building was situated, in order to ensure that the occupiers were not rendered homeless between the date of eviction and the date by which the City would have to provide emergency housing.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>The Court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation. </p>", "topics": ["sec_26__Housing"]}, {"id": "ConstitutionalityoftheMpumalangaPetitionsBillZACCSACCBCLR", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:23:15.823Z", "title": "Constitutionality of the Mpumalanga Petitions Bill, 2000 [2001] ZACC 10; 2002 (1) SA 447 (CC); 2001 (11) BCLR 1126", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2001/10/eng@2001-10-05", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The Premier of Mpumalanga, acting under section 121 of the Constitution, referred the Mpumalanga Petitions Bill to the Constitutional Court so they could decide on the constitutionality of the Bill because he had two reservations about its constitutionality. </p>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The first issue that the Premier raised was whether the legislature was permitted by <b>the Constitution</b> to pass the Petitions Bill.

The decisive question is whether private persons should be bound by the right in the Bill of Rights. In relation to security of tenure, the duty (both positive and negative) imposed by the right to security of tenure does in fact rest on private persons. People in need of protection under ESTA often reside on land owned by private persons, as in this case. The obligation resting on an owner is a positive one. A private party is required by <b>section 25(6) of the Constitution</b> through ESTA to accommodate another on their land.

This is because Part A of Schedule 5 of the Constitution lists the functional areas of exclusive provincial legislative competence and the fifth item is \u2018liquor licences\u2019. The President believed that the inclusion of this item meant that Parliament may, in terms of section 44(2) of the Constitution only intervene by passing legislation with regard to a matter falling within a functional area listed in Schedule 5, when it is necessary in certain prescribed circumstances.

The Minister argued further that even if the Bill infringed on the provinces\u2019 exclusive powers it was justified in terms of <b>section 44(2) of the Constitution</b>.

Cameron J explained that where it is evident that the matter requires regulation inter-provincially (between provinces) as opposed to intra-provincially (within a single province), then the matter will fall within Schedule 4. Where provinces are given exclusive powers in Schedule 5, these apply to matters which can be regulated intra-provincially. Cameron J formulated the \u201cpith and substance\u201d test for determining legislative competence, which looks at whether the substance of the Bill falls within Schedule 4 or 5.

It was held that the substance of the Bill was directed at three objectives. Firstly, the prohibition of cross-holdings between producers, distributors and retailers, and this was held to be an exclusive national competence. Secondly, the establishment of uniform conditions for national registration of manufacturers and distributors. Here it was held that provincial exclusive competence in relation to liquor licenses was not intended to cover the manufacturing and distribution of liquor because this was not an intra-provincial activity and was therefore an exclusive national competence. The third objective was to prescribe detailed mechanisms to provincial legislators for establishing retail licensing mechanisms. This was found to be an exclusive provincial competence under Schedule 5, which was liquor licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cameron J interpreted \u201cliquor licenses\u201d in Part A of Schedule 5 as referring to intra-provincial liquor licenses, but he found that even if exclusive provincial competence in respect of liquor licenses did extend to the manufacturing and distribution, national government\u2019s interest in maintaining economic unity would enable national government to intervene in terms of Section 44(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court concluded that the Liquor Bill was unconstitutional. In terms of Section 44(2), the national government was justified in intervening and creating a national system of registration for manufacturers and distributors and in prohibiting cross-holdings.

The provinces argued that the declaration of metropolitan areas is a provincial power which is incidental to the power to establish municipalities.

The Court rejected this argument by holding that a district management area is part of a district municipality and not a separate municipality. The Court found that the establishment of district management areas impacts on the boundaries of municipalities and is accordingly a function to be performed by the Demarcation Board.

The Court held that validity of legislation that gives the executive wide powers must be considered against the Constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers. By considering various foreign law approaches, the Court noted that Commonwealth countries had a clear separation of power when it came to the judiciary but that the separation between the legislature and executive is not as well defined.

The Court held that deviation from these constitutional requirements could potentially only be justified in exceptional circumstances such as war or under a state of emergency.

The Court then considered the alternative main argument that section 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 infringed sections 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution.

Accordingly, in this case, the Court analysed firstly whether section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>, relating to the right to freedom and security of the person. The Court emphasised that a broad interpretation should be given to the right at this stage as the second stage of the limitation test involving <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> prescribes the criteria that has to be met before an entrenched right can be justifiably limited. The Court held that section 417(2)(b) limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and then turned to the second stage of the limitation test. The second stage involved analysing whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable in a democratic society taking into account the prescribed factors in <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>.

FNB argued that the detention and sale by SARS in terms of section 114 where FNB was the owner of the motor vehicles but was not a customs debtor amounted to expropriation of the motor vehicles in terms of section 25. As FNB was not compensated for such expropriation as required in terms of section 25(2)(b) of the Constitution, FNB argued that that section 114 breached section 25(1) which provides that \u201cno one may be deprived of property, except in terms of law of general application and no law may permit arbitrary deprivation\u201d. </p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court in its analysis on the constitutional challenge to section 25 firstly analysed the meaning of section 25 and held that the provision mainly enshrines a negative protection of property.

The Court held that the deprivation is arbitrary \u201cwhen the \u2018law\u2019 referred to in section 25(1) does not provide sufficient reason for the particular deprivation in question or is procedurally unfair\u201d. The Court also gave a list of factors to be taken into account to determine whether there is \u2018sufficient reason\u2019, such as the nature and complexity of the relationship between the means and ends; and the nature or type of the right or property in question (i.e. ownership in land or other extensive property rights will require more justification in order to be sufficient).</p>\n\n<p>Following this analysis, the Court held that section 114 of the Act deprived FNB permanently of all its rights and benefits as owner of the vehicles. On applying the test for whether the deprivation was arbitrary or not, and therefore whether the deprivation was constitutional or not, the Court concluded that the deprivation, the seizure by SARS under section 114 of FNB\u2019s vehicles, was arbitrary and unconstitutional because there was insufficient reason justifying it. The Court held that: (i) there was no connection between the debt of the debtors and the owner of the property (FNB); (ii) there was no connection between the debt and the property (FNB\u2019s vehicles); (iii) the property owner (FNB) did not detriment SARS by placing the property (the vehicles) in the possession of the debtor hence there is no reason why the property owner should be subjected to interference or sanction.</p> \n\n<p>The Court therefore found section 114 of the Act unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed SARS to detain and sell seized property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>The core of the Constitutional Court\u2019s analysis related to the question whether section 114 of the Act infringed section 25 of the Constitution which provides for the right to property by allowing SARS to seize property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor. </p>", "topics": ["sec_25__Property_Rights"]}, {"id": "FosevMinisterofSafetyandSecurityZACCBCLRSA", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:26:24.657Z", "title": "Fose v Minister of Safety and Security [1997] ZACC 6; 1997 (7) BCLR 851; 1997 (3) SA 786", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/1997/6/eng@1997-06-05", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The applicant stated that members of the South African Police Services violated his fundamental rights through the widespread and persistent form of abuses including a series of assaults and torture over two days.

These provisions led to the disbanding of the Directorate of Special Operations, a specialised crime fighting unit located under the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and its replacement with the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), which is located within the South African Police Service (SAPS).The challenged laws were passed by Parliament and were assented to and signed by the President. The applicant challenged the constitutional validity of the laws based on the absence of a rational basis for the enactment of the laws in question. The applicant also alleged that the process of enactment failed to comply with various constitutional obligations relating to public participation, accountability, upholding international obligations, and allowing the NPA to properly exercise its functions. The High Court dismissed the constitutional challenges and held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the constitutional challenges as only the Constitutional Court had the authority to determine whether Parliament or the President had failed to fulfil their constitutional obligations. The High Court also held that the decision to disband the DSO and establish the DPCI within SAPS was aimed at enhancing the capacity of SAPS and was rational.</p>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The issue before the court was whether the national legislation that created DPCI and disbanded the DSO, is constitutionally valid. The applicant argued that the legislature violated various constitutional obligations such as the need to establish an independent crime fighting unit and to respect, protect, promote and fulfill the rights in the Bill of Rights. The amicus curiae, the Helen Suzman Foundation, argued that the constitutional obligation flows from various international treaties that South Africa ratified which required South Africa to establish an independent anti-corruption body and that the newly established DPCI, located within the SAPS, is not independent. </p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The majority judgment, penned by Moseneke DCJ and Cameron J, agreed with the minority that the applicant\u2019s rationality challenge and the allegation that Parliament failed to facilitate public involvement in the legislative process could not be upheld. The majority also agreed that section 179 of the Constitution does not oblige Parliament to locate a corruption-fighting unit only within the NPA. However, the majority disagreed with the minority view that the Constitution does not oblige the State to establish and maintain an independent corruption fighting body. The majority held that while the Constitution did not expressly demand that a corruption-fighting unit should be established, its scheme taken as a whole and international law agreements which are binding on the state imposed a pressing duty on the state to set up an effective and independent mechanism to prevent and root out corruption. The second issue considered was whether the legislation that gave effect to the DPCI met the requirements of independence and was therefore constitutionally compliant. \r\n\r\n</p><p>In considering the legislative provisions governing the DPCI, the majority held that it did not meet the constitutional requirement of appropriate independence. The reason for the majority\u2019s conclusion was that the DPCI was insufficiently protected from political influence in its structure and functioning. A key concern was the fact that policy guidelines relating to the functioning of the DPCI was to be determined by a ministerial committee which created a risk of executive and political influence on investigations and compromises the body\u2019s independence.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The majority therefore upheld the appeal and declared that the legislative provisions establishing the DPCI constitutionally invalid to the extent that they did not secure adequate independence, and suspended the declaration of constitutional invalidity for a period of eighteen months to give Parliament the opportunity to remedy the defect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minority judgment written by Ngcobo J dismissed the applicant\u2019s rationality challenge and the applicant\u2019s allegation that Parliament failed to facilitate public involvement in the legislative process. Ngcobo J held that the Constitution makes it clear that South African law must be interpreted in a manner that complies with international law. In relation to section 37 of the Constitution, Ngcobo J pointed out that section 37(4)(b)(i) requires legislation that derogates from the Bill of Rights to be \u201cconsistent with the Republic\u2019s obligations under international law applicable to states of emergency.\u201d This provision together with sections 39 and 233 of the Constitution indicate that international law has a special place in our law according to Ngcobo J.  Ngcobo J, however, held that while section 7(2) of the Constitution gives rise to an obligation on the state to fight corruption and organised crime, it did not specifically impose an obligation on the state to establish an independent corruption-fighting unit. It further held that, insofar as such a constitutional obligation is found, the structural and operational autonomy of the DPCI was secured through institutional and legal mechanisms that were adequately designed to prevent undue interference and safeguarded the independence of the DPCI.</p>\r</div>", "snippet": "<p>The issue before the court was whether the national legislation that created DPCI and disbanded the DSO, is constitutionally valid. </p>", "topics": ["sec_37__States_of_Emergency"]}, {"id": "GovernmentoftheRepublicofSouthAfricaandOthersvGrootboomandOthersZACCSABCLR", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:36:32.720Z", "title": "Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Others [2000] ZACC 19; 2001 (1) SA 46; 2000 (11) BCLR 1169\n", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2000/19/eng@2000-10-04", "facts_and_issues": "<div><p>Ms Grootboom was one of the people in a group of 510 children and 390 adults who were living in appalling circumstances in the Wallacedene informal settlement.

For a person to have access to adequate housing, the Court held that there had to be the provision of land, services (such as the provision of water, the removal of sewage and the financing of all these) and a dwelling.\r\n\r\n</p><p>The Court further held that <b>section 26</b> placed an obligation on the State and all other entities and persons to desist from preventing or impairing the right of access to adequate housing.

The program, although laudable, concentrated unduly on the goal of constructing permanent houses for as many people as possible over time, instead of providing some form of shelter for the desperate in the interim.

The Court ordered the School to amend its Code of Conduct to provide for exemption procedures allowing learners, on genuine cultural or religious grounds, to apply for permission to deviate from the uniform and other standards and requirements of the Code of Conduct, thereby allowing for the rights and interests to be weighed and balanced in the specific circumstances on a case-by-case basis.</p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court noted that whilst uniforms and school rules serve an important purpose in education, the case was not about uniforms in general, but about a specific exemption to a uniform.

On this basis, the Court rejected the suggestion that the learner could attend another school as the Constitution requires for difference to be reasonably accommodated and celebrated.

Religion is dealt with without mention of culture in <b>section 15</b>, which entrenches the right to freedom of belief and conscience. By associating religion with belief and conscience, which involve an individual\u2019s state of mind, religion is understood in an individualist sense: a set of beliefs that an individual may hold regardless of the beliefs of others. The exclusion of culture from <b>section 15</b> suggests that culture is different. The inclusion of culture in <b>section 30</b> and <b>section 31</b> makes it clear that by and large culture as conceived in our Constitution, involves associative practices and not individual beliefs. So, <b>section 31</b> speaks of the right of persons who are members of religious, linguistic or cultural communities \u201cwith other members of that community\u201d to enjoy their culture.</p> \n\n<p>However, religion, according to O\u2019Regan J, need not be associative at all. A religious belief can be entirely personal. The importance of a personal religious belief is more often than not based on a particular relationship with a deity or deities that may have little bearing on community or associative practices. Where one is dealing with personal and individualised belief, religion is to be considered differently to culture, as the Constitution makes clear. In such circumstances, it is appropriate for a court to ask whether the belief is sincerely held in order to decide whether a litigant has established that it falls within the scope of section 15. If a sincere religious belief is established, it seems correct that a court will not investigate the belief further as the cases cited by the Chief Justice in his judgment make plain. A religious belief is personal, and need not be rational, nor need it be shared by others. A court must simply be persuaded that it is a profound and sincerely held belief.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>This case concerned whether the rule prohibiting the wearing of jewellery had the potential for indirect discrimination because it allowed certain groups of learners to express their religious and cultural identity freely, while denying that right to others.</p>", "topics": ["sec_15__Freedom_of_Religion_Belief_and_Opinion", "sec_31__Cultural_Religious_and_Linguistic_Communities"]}, {"id": "MECDepartmentofAgricultureConservationandEnvironmentandAnothervHTFDevelopersPtyLimitedZACCSACCBCLRCC", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:48:59.576Z", "title": "MEC: Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment and Another v HTF Developers (Pty) Limited [2007] ZACC 25; 2008 (2) SA 319 (CC); 2008 (4) BCLR 417 (CC)", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2007/25/eng@2007-12-06", "facts_and_issues": "<div><p>The case is concerned primarily with the interaction between two sections of the Environment Conservation Act 73 of 1989 (ECA), which allowed the applicant to prevent the development of a housing estate as a result of the applicant\u2019s understanding that the development threatened the existence of certain Red Data species and naturally existing corridors that are formed by naturally formed geological ridges in Gauteng.

Transfer of any property may not be approved without a clearance certificate issued by the municipality as proof that such consumption charges have been paid. At the core of the challenge was that these provisions gave rise to arbitrary deprivation of property and violated the protection afforded in terms of <b>section 25(1) of the Constitution</b>. The South Eastern Cape Local Division of the High Court (the High Court) declared <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> unconstitutional in the Mkontwana matter and Bisset matter and these matters were referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm the confirmation of constitutional invalidity. In both these matters the Minister responsible for Local Government opposed the confirmation and appealed the High Court\u2019s order. The third matter, the Transfer Rights Action Campaign matter concerned an application for direct access to the Constitutional Court, relating to the constitutionality of national, provincial and local government legislation including <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em>.

The majority judgment by Yacoob J confirmed that these provisions are not only limited to the non-payment of consumption charges due by the owner, but also extends to the non-payment of consumption charges due by occupiers other than the owner.</p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court then turned to the question whether these provisions resulted in a deprivation of property. <b>Section 25(1)(a) of the Constitution</b> strictly provides protection against deprivation of property and provides that \u201cno law may permit arbitrary deprivation of property\u201d. The Court recognised that almost all the parties were in agreement that <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> and <b>section 50(1)(a)</b> of the <em>Ordinance</em> brought about deprivation of property. The Court dismissed the argument that these provisions were only regulatory in nature and held that a <b>\u201csubstantial interference\u201d</b> with the enjoyment or use of property that goes beyond the normal restrictions would amount to deprivation. The deprivation here was that owners were unable to transfer their properties unless consumption charges due by people other than themselves and for which they were not liable had been paid. The Court then turned to whether this deprivation was arbitrary. \n\n</p><p>The Court held that there must be <b>\u201csufficient reason\u201d</b> for the deprivation or else it would be arbitrary, and the greater the deprivation the more compelling the reason for such deprivation must be. The Court reasoned that the requirement served the important purpose of encouraging payment and considering the various categories of occupiers, the owner is usually in a position to take reasonable steps to prevent the unreasonable accumulation of outstanding consumption charges. It was therefore reasonable for the owner to bear this risk. Even in the case of unlawful occupiers, the owner is in the position to take reasonable steps to ensure it is not unlawfully occupied, by securing the property and instituting eviction proceedings to ensure such occupiers do not remain on the property for long. The deprivation in question related to one element of ownership (the right to alienate property). The Court emphasised that this was not an insubstantial deprivation as the provision requires the owner of the property to bear the risk of non-payment of consumption charges by non-owner occupiers. The Court stated that the relationship between the owner, the property and the consumption charge was sufficiently close to require the owner to bear the risk of non-payment and <b>section 118(1)</b> was not found to be arbitrary, Similarly, in cases of unlawful occupation the burden placed on the owner was held not to render <b>section 118(1)</b> arbitrary.</p>\n\n<p>The Court also held that that procedural fairness necessitates that all municipalities must, on the written request of owners, provide owners with copies of electricity and water accounts sent to occupiers.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>There were three cases before the court, and they were all concerned with the constitutional validity of laws that in effect burden owners in relation to consumption charges for water and electricity supplied to other people who occupy their immovable property. </p>", "topics": ["sec_25__Property_Rights"]}, {"id": "MlungwanaandOthersvSandAnotherZACCBCLRCCSACRCC", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:53:05.576Z", "title": "Mlungwana and Others v S and Another [2018] ZACC 45; 2019 (1) BCLR 88 (CC); 2019 (1) SACR 429 (CC)\n", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2018/45/eng@2018-11-19", "facts_and_issues": "<div><p>The matter was referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm an order of constitutional invalidity made by the High Court, Western Cape division.

This section created a criminal offence for the failure to give notice or to fail to give adequate notice to a local municipality for a gathering of more than 15 people, even if such a gathering was peaceful and unarmed. The applicants argued that such criminalisation is not constitutionally permissible because section 12(1)(a) criminalises peaceful gatherings merely because no notice was given or inadequate notice was given.</p>\n<p>The applicants travelled as a group to picket at the Cape Town Civic Centre to voice their dissatisfaction with inadequate sanitation facilities in Khayelitsha. The picket was peaceful and unarmed but grew in size at the venue as more people joined in. The applicants were then arrested and charged for contravening <strong>section 12(1)(a) of the Act</strong> and charged with the offence of failing to give notice of an assembly in terms of section 12(1)(a) of the Act. One of the defences raised by the applicants during the trial was the constitutional validity of section 12(1)(a) of the Act and the Magistrates\u2019 Court granted the applicants leave to appeal to the High Court to challenge the constitutionality of this provision. The High Court found section 12(1)(a) of the Act had a \u201cchilling\u201d and deterring effect on section 17 of the Constitution and unjustifiably limited the right.

Following a generous interpretation of section 17 of the Constitution, anything that would prevent people from assembling peacefully and unarmed would limit the right.</p>\n<p>The Court at this stage of the analysis also dismissed the respondents\u2019 claim that section 12(1)(a) of the Act merely regulates the right as the criminal sanction created by this provision is a deterrence to exercising the right enshrined in section 17 of the Constitution. The Court found that section 12(1)(a) limited section 17 of the Constitution and turned to consider whether this limitation could be justified in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>On analysing the limitation in terms of the factors listed in section 36(1) of the Constitution, the Court on considering the nature of the right, recognised that the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed is central to South Africa\u2019s constitutional democracy. The Court emphasised that the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed is a powerful tool for people who lack both political and economic power to have their voices heard and that the right enables people to exercise other constitutional rights. The Court found that there was a weak link between the criminal sanction and the achievement of section 12(1)(a)\u2019s purpose of preventing violent protests.</p>\n<p>On considering the nature and extent of the limitation, the Court held that the limitation is severe for the following reasons:</p>\n<p>i) the definitions of \u201cgatherings\u201d and \u201cconveners\u201d in the Act are overly broad;</p>\n<p>ii) criminalization can result in punishment, moral stigma, and a criminal record for at least ten years;</p>\n<p>iii) criminalisation not only has a severe impact on the person sanctioned but also has a wider far-reaching effect on those who wish to protest;</p>\n<p>iv) where there is no convener, any person who plays a role (whether it is minor or major) in planning the protest can be held criminally liable; and</p>\n<p>v) the limitation does not distinguish between adult and minor conveners.</p>\n<p>The Court held that there were other less restrictive means that could have been imposed such as administrative fines or imposing civil liability.

On the right to privacy, the Court explained that this constitutional right allows people to enjoy a degree of private intimacy and autonomy free from outside interference and that giving expression to sexuality is at the heart of this private intimacy. Any intrusion upon consensual acts which cause no harm within this sphere breaches the right to privacy.

On the municipality\u2019s version, the occupiers had been living on the land for periods ranging from two to eight years and had not applied to the municipality for housing. The occupiers  indicated that they were willing to leave the property if given reasonable notice and provided suitable alternative land to which they could move. The occupiers were told they could move to a place referred to as Walmer Township (Walmer), however they rejected the proposal saying the area was crime-ridden and over-crowded and further that they feared they would have no security of occupation there and find themselves liable to further eviction. The municipality argued that if alternative land was made available to them, they would be disrupting the housing programme and forcing the municipality to grant them preferential treatment. The Municipality applied to the South Eastern Cape Local Division of the High Court for an eviction order against the occupiers and the Court ordered the occupiers to vacate the land and authorised the Sheriff to demolish the structures. The occupiers then appealed the High Court\u2019s order to the SCA. The SCA held that the availability of alternative land was a key factor in the matter and considering that it was unclear whether Walmer was owned by the State or privately, the High Court should not have made this order without confirming whether there would be security of tenure for the occupiers when relocated.</p>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Constitutional Court had to determine whether the decision of the SCA to set aside the eviction order should be overturned.

One of the provisions of the Bill of Rights that has to be interpreted with these values in mind, is <b>section 25</b>, which provides the right to property. This matter accordingly turned on determining the constitutional relationship between <b>section 25</b> and <b>section 26</b>. Sections 25 and 26 create an overlap between land rights and socio-economic rights and it is the duty of the state to fulfil both rights. The court held that the provisions of <b>section 25, subsections 4-9</b> must be borne in mind whenever <b>section 25</b> was being construed; this is because under the Constitution, the protection of property as an individual right was not absolute but subject to societal considerations. The Court also held that the state has a duty to satisfy both property and housing rights provided for in <b>sections 25 and 26 of the Constitution and must seek to balance these rights</b> Section 26(3) of the Constitution demonstrates special constitutional consideration for a person\u2019s home and acknowledges that a home is more than just a shelter from the elements, but is also an area of personal intimacy and family security. \n\n</p><p>The Court furthermore held that the <em>Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act 19 of 1998 (PIE)</em> cannot simply be looked at as a legislative mechanism to re-establish common law property rights.

Under PIE squatting was decriminalised and evictions were subject to requirements in line with the Bill of Rights. The provisions of PIE must be considered against the values of South Africa\u2019s new constitutional dispensation. In making its decision, the court must consider all relevant circumstances, including the manner in which occupation was effected, its duration and the availability of suitable alternative accommodation or land, the motivation for settling on land, the degree of desperation of people who have sought land, and whether people occupied land with a plausible belief that they have permission to be there (as opposed to those who deliberately invade land to deliberately disrupt the organised housing programme and place themselves at the front of the queue). Regarding suitable alternative accommodation, the Court emphasised that this will vary from municipality to municipality and depends on the number of people facing eviction in each case and whether the municipality is able to secure suitable accommodation for unlawful occupiers without prejudicing the claims of lawful occupiers and those in line for formal housing.</p>\n\n<p>The Court held that considering the period which the occupiers have lived on the land, the fact that eviction is not necessary for the land to be used productively and that this is a relatively small group of people who appear to be genuinely homeless and in need, it would not be just and equitable to order the eviction.

Parliament had a wide discretion in choosing how to combat social problems, including through the creation of new offences. Furthermore, the courts must give effect to legislative choices made by Parliament except where the choices are not in line with the Constitution.

The applicants\u2019 argued that it was not rational for a convener of a gathering to take all reasonable steps to prevent an act or omission even if that act or omission was not reasonably foreseeable. Mogoeng CJ, considered the meaning of the provision and held that there is a connection between the steps that a convener takes, within its power, and preventing harm that is reasonably foreseeable. If appropriate steps are adopted when planning a gathering and these steps are reasonable to prevent foreseeable outcomes, the taking of such steps would render any act or omission that resulted in riot damage to be classified as reasonably unforeseeable. The defence was therefore found to be rational.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Mogoeng CJ, then turned to considered whether the provision limited section 17 of the Constitution. Mogoeng J held that section 11(2) of the Regulation of Gatherings Act does limit section 17 of the Constitution as it requires conveners of gatherings to adhere to the requirements and can potentially increase the cost of organising a protest which could bar under-resourced organisations from being able to protest. The question was whether this limitation could be justified in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution as a reasonable and justifiable limitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On conducting the limitation analysis in terms of section 36 of the Constitution, and looking at the importance of the right to assemble, the Court emphasised that the right to freedom of assembly is central to our constitutional democracy. It exists to give a voice to less powerful people in society and groups that do not wield political or economic power and other vulnerable persons. The right may be the only mechanism for such persons to express their concerns. Bearing in mind the significance of this right, the purpose of the limitation must be important enough to justify the limitation. The Court held that the purpose of the limitation, to protect individuals, especially those who themselves are under-resourced, who suffer damages caused by protests, is a crucial one. The Court reasoned that the public has no means to control protests whereas organisers are in a position to control and manage protests. Organizations have a choice between exercising the right to assemble or abandoning protests in order to prevent reasonably foreseeable damage. Conversely, victims of riot damage have no choice regarding what may happen to them or their property. Therefore, the Court held that the justification provided for by the law was viable and that the limitation on the right to freedom of assembly in <b>section 17 of the Constitution</b> was held to be reasonable and justifiable. The Court emphasized that the Regulation of Gatherings Act does not nullify the right to freedom of assembly, but imposes strict conditions on the right in order to prevent injury to persons or property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a concurring judgment, Jafta J held that the appeal should be dismissed, on the basis that the applicants had failed to prove that section 11(2) of the Regulations of Gatherings Act limited the right to freedom of assembly.

As a matter of logic what is bad for all children will be bad for one child in a particular case.

Kondile AJ, writing for the majority, started the equality analysis by firstly considering, whether the provision differentiated between categories of people and if there was such differentiation whether there was a legitimate rationale for such differentiation. During this first leg of the analysis, looking at the rational connection between the provision and its purpose, the Court emphasised that the private security industry was a special environment and at stake was the safety and security of the public at large. <b>Section 12 of the Constitution</b> provides everyone with the right to freedom and security of the person, which includes the right to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources. In a society rife with violent crime, the importance of protecting this right could not be exaggerated.\n\n</p><p>The majority judgment held that the regulatory scheme was carefully designed for the purpose of screening entrants to the private security industry rather than constituting a blanket ban on the registration of refugees as private security service providers. That is not to say that foreign nationals, including refugees, are inherently less trustworthy than South Africans. In a country where xenophobia has caused increased suffering, it was important to stress this and explain that it was not that the Authority did not trust refugees. The Security Act was designed to limit eligibility for registration to people whose trustworthiness could be objectively verified, and it was easier to verify the trustworthiness of citizens and permanent residents. The preamble to the Act acknowledges that the right to security of the person is fundamental to the well-being and to the social and economic development of every person. The Court therefore held that the differentiation between citizens and permanent residents on one hand and other foreigners in this instance, was rational and served a legitimate government purpose.</p> \n\n<p>On establishing differentiation, the majority judgment then considered whether the differentiation amounted to discrimination. The Court held that in this instance, the differentiation was on grounds analogous to those listed in section 9(3) of the Constitution, and therefore constituted discrimination. The analysis then turned to whether the discrimination was unfair. Various factors were considered by the Court on the question of fairness, such as the fact that  while refugees were fully entitled to work in South Africa, <b>section 22 of the Constitution</b> limited the right to choose a job to citizens only. The Court also considered that refugees could be registered as security service providers if the requirements of section 23(6) of the Security Act were met and that there was no complete exclusion of refugees from being registered. The majority found that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act did not unfairly discriminate against the applicants and was therefore constitutionally sound.</p>\n\n<p>In their dissenting judgment, Mokgoro J and O'Regan J held that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act discriminated unfairly on the basis of refugee status. The joint dissenting judgment was not convinced that the purpose identified by the Minister to ensure that security service employees were trustworthy was really intended by the section. The dissenting judgment stated that the order it would have proposed was to require that refugees who could meet the other requirements of the Security Act should not be barred from registration as security service providers. Those refugees who could not meet those requirements should seek to establish that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for them to be registered as contemplated by section 23(6) of the Security Act.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>The Constitutional Court had to determine whether the Authority\u2019s refusal to register the applicants as security service providers, on the basis that they are neither permanent residents nor citizens, was justified and whether section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act to the extent it excluded refugees from its scope constituted unfair discrimination in violation of section 9 of the Constitution.</p>", "topics": ["sec_12__Freedom_and_Security_of_the_Person"]}, {"id": "UniversityofStellenboschLegalAidClinicandOthersvMinisterofJusticeandCorrectionalServicesandOthersAssociationofDebtRecoveryAgentsNPCvUniversityofStellenboschLegalAidClinicandOthersMavavaTradingPtyLtdandOthersvUniversityofStellenboschLegalAidClinicandOthers", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T19:14:29.464Z", "title": "University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic and Others v Minister of Justice and Correctional Services and Others; Association of Debt Recovery Agents NPC v University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic and Others (CCT 127/15) [2016] ZACC 32", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2016/32/eng@2016-09-13", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The matter was referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm an order of constitutional invalidity made by the Western Cape Division of the High Court and an appeal was made against certain parts of the High Court\u2019s order.

The clients had approached a company known as SA Multiloan in Stellenbosch for small loans.

Once issued, section 65J(5) provides that the order may be executed \u2018as if it were a court judgment\u2019. The majority viewed this wording as demonstrating that the section permits execution without judicial oversight.

This Proclamation governed the setting-up of special African townships by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in areas under the African Native Trust. This Proclamation was one of the tools with which the apartheid state disposed Africans from landholding and created barriers to Africans owning any land. Instead, Africans could only hold rights to the lands through an insecure tenure system of Deeds of Grant and Certificates of Occupancy and letting for residential purposes. The township manager had the authority to cancel this tenure at any point. Special deeds registries were created to register the deeds of grant under the legislation.</p>\n<p>When South Africa transitioned to democratic majority rule, the President, empowered by the Interim Constitution, passed Proclamation R9 of 1997 together with amendments to the Deeds Registry Act.

The President also delegated certain legislative competencies to the provincial legislations to ensure multi-level governance.\u00a0<br>Consequently, the North West passed the North West Act 7 which supposedly repealed the whole of Proclamation R293.

The applicants argued that neither of these categories of persons were able to retain or obtain South African citizenship following the 2010 Amendment.

Interrelated to this question was whether the phrase \u2018any person who is born\u2019 in section 2(1)(b) meant that the section applied only to future persons born to South African citizens, or whether it could be interpreted to include past births too. </p> If the section only applied to future cases, it would have deprived people entitled to citizenship by descent under the previous version of the Citizenship Act merely because they were born before 1 January 2013. \n</div>", "interpretation": "<div><p>Section 2(1) of the 2010 Amendment classifies a citizen as any person who: </p><p>(a) who immediately prior to the commencement of the 2010 Amendment was a South African citizen  by birth  (i.e. immediately  prior to 1 January 2013); or</p> <p>(b) who is born in or outside of South Africa to a South African citizen.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitutional Court interpreted <b>section 2(1)(a) and (b) of the amended Citizenship Act</b> in a way that it did not arbitrarily deprive persons of their citizenship overnight. The Constitutional Court held that it was clear that section 2(1)(a) retains citizenship only for those who were considered \u201ccitizens by birth\u201d before the commencement of the 2010 Amendment. This could create an anomaly as persons who acquired citizenship by descent under the previous version of the Citizenship Act would now be excluded. This apparent exclusion could be resolved by adopting a purposive interpretation of section 2(1)(b). \n\n</p><p>The Court interpreted the term \u2018is born\u2019 in section 2(1)(b) as a \u201cstate of being\u201d not indicative of a tense, but rather including all persons regardless of when they were born. The Court held that this was a reasonable and constitutionally compliant interpretation which meant that section 2 was applicable to persons born to a South African parent before and after 1 January 2013, curing the anomaly. </p> This interpretation allowed for all categories of citizens who acquired citizenship by birth or descent in terms of the previous version of the Citizenship Act to be included. As the 2010 Amendment could be interpreted in a constitutionally compliant manner, the findings of invalidity in the High Court were not confirmed by the Constitutional Court. \n\n<p>The Constitutional Court thereby ensured that the sections of the 2010 Amendment would be interpreted and applied consistently with <b>section 20 of the Constitution</b>.</p> \n\n<p>(i) On section 20 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court held that although the importance of citizenship should not be overemphasised, citizenship is a gateway right to many other constitutional rights \u2013 namely, freedom of movement, freedom of trade and political rights, and is more than a legal status. Citizenship related to the core of a person\u2019s identity, a sense of belonging in a community and to security of a person most especially in communities rife with xenophobia. Deprivation of, or interference with, a person\u2019s citizenship status affects their private and family life, their choices concerning where establish their homes, apply for jobs, enrol in schools; whether they can form part of the community; their ability to participate fully in the political activity and governance; and the extent to which they may exercise freedom of movement.</p>\n\n<p>(ii) The Constitutional Court held that whilst certain rights in the Constitution are only available to South African citizens, drawing arbitrary and irrational distinctions between citizens and non-citizens through legislation or decision-making is inconsistent with the Constitution. </p>\n\n<p>(iii) Legislation must be interpreted to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, but any interpretation must remain consistent with the text of the legislation.

The Constitutional Court adopted an interpretation that was consistent with and promoted both the text of the section (by recognising that the section\u2019s language is not time-specific but rather linked to a condition of having been born) as well as the Bill of Rights (not to arbitrarily deprive persons of their citizenship overnight, as required by section 20 linked to other constitutional rights).</p>\n</div>", "snippet": "<p>The Court had to determine whether section 2(1)(a) and (b) of the South African Citizenship Act 88 of 1995 (the \u201cCitizenship Act\u201d), as amended by the South African Citizenship Amendment Act 17 of 2010 (the \u201c2010 Amendment\u201d), was unconstitutional and invalid.\n</p>", "topics": ["sec_20__Citizenship", "sec_3__Citizenship"]}, {"id": "CityofJohannesburgMetropolitanMunicipalityvBlueMoonlightPropertiesPtyLtdandAnotherCCZACCBCLRCCSACC", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T15:45:56.721Z", "title": "City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality v Blue Moonlight Properties 39 (Pty) Ltd and Another (CC) [2011] ZACC 33; 2012 (2) BCLR 150 (CC); 2012 (2) SA 104 (CC)\n", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2011/33/eng@2011-12-01", "facts_and_issues": "<div><p>This case concerns the conflict between the constitutional right to adequate housing in terms of section 26(2) of the Constitution and a property owner\u2019s right to develop private property.  86 indigent individuals were unlawfully occupying private unused industrial facilities as living quarters. The owner of the property (Blue Moonlight) approached the South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg seeking an order to evict the occupiers in order to develop the property. The occupiers opposed the eviction on the basis that it would almost certainly render them homeless and argued that the City of Johannesburg (the City)  had an obligation to provide them with temporary housing under the Constitution and the <b>Prevention of Illegal Eviction and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act, 19 of 1998 (PIE)</b> before they could be evicted.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>The High Court granted the eviction order, but also ordered the City to remedy its housing policy as it was found to be unconstitutional and the High Court issued a structural interdict against the City obliging the City to report back to the High Court on the steps taken remedying its housing policy.

The City subsequently appealed the High Court\u2019s order to  the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). The SCA only set aside the structural interdict against the City and the High Court\u2019s compensation order and declared the City\u2019s housing policy unconstitutional to the extent that it excluded the occupiers from temporary housing and the City was ordered to provide them with \u201ctemporary emergency accommodation\u201d.

The City argued that it was neither obliged nor able to provide emergency accommodation in these circumstances and that its role in this regard was secondary. The City argued that local government does not have a primary role in fulfilling the right to access to adequate housing and that this mandate falls on the shoulders of the national and provincial government. The City argued that it fulfilled its duties after requesting assistance from provincial government and no more could be expected from it. The occupiers opposed the City\u2019s appeal and also applied for a conditional cross-appeal requesting that an order of eviction be linked to the condition that suitable alternative accommodation be provided and that the City report back on steps taken to remedying its housing policy.</p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>In a unanimous judgment by Van der Westhuizen J, the Court held that an owner's constitutional right not to be deprived of property must be interpreted in the social and historical context and be balanced against the right of access to adequate housing and not to be evicted arbitrarily from one's home. The Court emphasised that apartheid legislation undermined both the right of access to adequate housing and the right to property. Section 25 prohibits arbitrary deprivation of property, but also undertakes to redress unequal social conditions.</p>  Section 26 of the Constitution \u201chighlights the transformative vision of the Constitution\u201d and PIE was enacted to specifically prevent the historical abuse of displacement of people. In this case, even though housing unlawful occupiers indefinitely suspends an owner's right to use and enjoy property, evictions can only be carried out in terms of PIE. PIE allows for the eviction of unlawful occupiers only in circumstances where such eviction is just and equitable.\r\n\r\n<p>In deciding whether an eviction is just and equitable in terms of PIE, the Court considered that many of the occupiers had lived on the property for a very long time, the occupation had once been lawful, Blue Moonlight was aware of the occupiers\u2019 presence when it purchased the property, and the eviction of the occupiers would render them homeless while there was no competing risk of homelessness on the part of Blue Moonlight. Furthermore, the Court held that a key consideration was whether the City had made reasonable efforts to provide alternative accommodation to the occupiers. After considering the City\u2019s housing policy, the Court noted that the policy differentiated between persons relocated by the City itself and those evicted by private landowners. However, where relocation was sought by the City, these persons were housed in temporary accommodation, which was not the case with persons evicted by private landowners.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Court emphasised that section 26(2) of the Constitution recognises that the state is constrained by resources in giving effect to the right to adequate housing and therefore a housing policy may differentiate and give preference to categories of people; however any differentiation must be rational. The City\u2019s housing policy was found to be \u201crigid\u201d. The Court held that the policy failed to take into account whether emergency accommodation should be made available in individual cases, considering the categories of persons affected (such as elderly people and children) and their circumstances, and that an imminent eviction might render them homeless, regardless of whether the eviction or relocation is sought by the City or a private landowner. The Court held that this differentiation was not rational. Where an eviction may result in homelessness, it is irrelevant whether such eviction is at the instance of the City or a private landowner. The Court emphasised that this matter concerns \u201ctemporary\u201d accommodation in an emergency as defined in Chapter 12 of the National Housing Code and not \u201cpermanent\u201d housing. The obligation, while derived from the right to progressive realisation of adequate housing in terms of <b>section 26(2) of the Constitution</b>, is distinct from the obligation to address permanent housing needs.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Court therefore declared the City\u2019s housing policy unconstitutional and in violation of section 26 of the Constitution to the extent that it excluded people evicted by private landowners from its temporary housing programme. The Court dismissed the City\u2019s appeal and held that the occupiers had to vacate the properties by a given date. The Court stipulated that the City was to provide the evictees with \"temporary accommodation in a location as near as feasibly possible to the area\" in which the building was situated, in order to ensure that the occupiers were not rendered homeless between the date of eviction and the date by which the City would have to provide emergency housing.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>The Court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation. </p>", "topics": ["sec_26__Housing"]}, {"id": "ConstitutionalityoftheMpumalangaPetitionsBillZACCSACCBCLR", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:23:15.823Z", "title": "Constitutionality of the Mpumalanga Petitions Bill, 2000 [2001] ZACC 10; 2002 (1) SA 447 (CC); 2001 (11) BCLR 1126", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2001/10/eng@2001-10-05", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The Premier of Mpumalanga, acting under section 121 of the Constitution, referred the Mpumalanga Petitions Bill to the Constitutional Court so they could decide on the constitutionality of the Bill because he had two reservations about its constitutionality. </p>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The first issue that the Premier raised was whether the legislature was permitted by <b>the Constitution</b> to pass the Petitions Bill.

Ms Daniels obtained interim order from the Stellenbosch Magistrate\u2019s Court for the restoration of her undisturbed occupation on the farm and required Mr Scribante to repair and replace the door and restore the electricity supply. Mr Scribante then ceased to maintain the dwelling. The dwelling required improvements which would enable it to be fit for human living.

The Court held that whether private persons will be bound by section 8(2) depends on a number of factors:</p>\r\n<p>(i)\tWhat is the nature of the right? (Is the obligation positive or negative?

The decisive question is whether private persons should be bound by the right in the Bill of Rights. In relation to security of tenure, the duty (both positive and negative) imposed by the right to security of tenure does in fact rest on private persons. People in need of protection under ESTA often reside on land owned by private persons, as in this case. The obligation resting on an owner is a positive one. A private party is required by <b>section 25(6) of the Constitution</b> through ESTA to accommodate another on their land.

This is because Part A of Schedule 5 of the Constitution lists the functional areas of exclusive provincial legislative competence and the fifth item is \u2018liquor licences\u2019. The President believed that the inclusion of this item meant that Parliament may, in terms of section 44(2) of the Constitution only intervene by passing legislation with regard to a matter falling within a functional area listed in Schedule 5, when it is necessary in certain prescribed circumstances.

The Minister argued further that even if the Bill infringed on the provinces\u2019 exclusive powers it was justified in terms of <b>section 44(2) of the Constitution</b>.

Cameron J explained that where it is evident that the matter requires regulation inter-provincially (between provinces) as opposed to intra-provincially (within a single province), then the matter will fall within Schedule 4. Where provinces are given exclusive powers in Schedule 5, these apply to matters which can be regulated intra-provincially. Cameron J formulated the \u201cpith and substance\u201d test for determining legislative competence, which looks at whether the substance of the Bill falls within Schedule 4 or 5.

It was held that the substance of the Bill was directed at three objectives. Firstly, the prohibition of cross-holdings between producers, distributors and retailers, and this was held to be an exclusive national competence. Secondly, the establishment of uniform conditions for national registration of manufacturers and distributors. Here it was held that provincial exclusive competence in relation to liquor licenses was not intended to cover the manufacturing and distribution of liquor because this was not an intra-provincial activity and was therefore an exclusive national competence. The third objective was to prescribe detailed mechanisms to provincial legislators for establishing retail licensing mechanisms. This was found to be an exclusive provincial competence under Schedule 5, which was liquor licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cameron J interpreted \u201cliquor licenses\u201d in Part A of Schedule 5 as referring to intra-provincial liquor licenses, but he found that even if exclusive provincial competence in respect of liquor licenses did extend to the manufacturing and distribution, national government\u2019s interest in maintaining economic unity would enable national government to intervene in terms of Section 44(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court concluded that the Liquor Bill was unconstitutional. In terms of Section 44(2), the national government was justified in intervening and creating a national system of registration for manufacturers and distributors and in prohibiting cross-holdings.

The provinces argued that the declaration of metropolitan areas is a provincial power which is incidental to the power to establish municipalities.

The Court rejected this argument by holding that a district management area is part of a district municipality and not a separate municipality. The Court found that the establishment of district management areas impacts on the boundaries of municipalities and is accordingly a function to be performed by the Demarcation Board.

The Court held that validity of legislation that gives the executive wide powers must be considered against the Constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers. By considering various foreign law approaches, the Court noted that Commonwealth countries had a clear separation of power when it came to the judiciary but that the separation between the legislature and executive is not as well defined.

The Court held that deviation from these constitutional requirements could potentially only be justified in exceptional circumstances such as war or under a state of emergency.

The Court then considered the alternative main argument that section 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 infringed sections 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution.

Accordingly, in this case, the Court analysed firstly whether section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>, relating to the right to freedom and security of the person. The Court emphasised that a broad interpretation should be given to the right at this stage as the second stage of the limitation test involving <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> prescribes the criteria that has to be met before an entrenched right can be justifiably limited. The Court held that section 417(2)(b) limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and then turned to the second stage of the limitation test. The second stage involved analysing whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable in a democratic society taking into account the prescribed factors in <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>.

FNB argued that the detention and sale by SARS in terms of section 114 where FNB was the owner of the motor vehicles but was not a customs debtor amounted to expropriation of the motor vehicles in terms of section 25. As FNB was not compensated for such expropriation as required in terms of section 25(2)(b) of the Constitution, FNB argued that that section 114 breached section 25(1) which provides that \u201cno one may be deprived of property, except in terms of law of general application and no law may permit arbitrary deprivation\u201d. </p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court in its analysis on the constitutional challenge to section 25 firstly analysed the meaning of section 25 and held that the provision mainly enshrines a negative protection of property.

The Court held that the deprivation is arbitrary \u201cwhen the \u2018law\u2019 referred to in section 25(1) does not provide sufficient reason for the particular deprivation in question or is procedurally unfair\u201d. The Court also gave a list of factors to be taken into account to determine whether there is \u2018sufficient reason\u2019, such as the nature and complexity of the relationship between the means and ends; and the nature or type of the right or property in question (i.e. ownership in land or other extensive property rights will require more justification in order to be sufficient).</p>\n\n<p>Following this analysis, the Court held that section 114 of the Act deprived FNB permanently of all its rights and benefits as owner of the vehicles. On applying the test for whether the deprivation was arbitrary or not, and therefore whether the deprivation was constitutional or not, the Court concluded that the deprivation, the seizure by SARS under section 114 of FNB\u2019s vehicles, was arbitrary and unconstitutional because there was insufficient reason justifying it. The Court held that: (i) there was no connection between the debt of the debtors and the owner of the property (FNB); (ii) there was no connection between the debt and the property (FNB\u2019s vehicles); (iii) the property owner (FNB) did not detriment SARS by placing the property (the vehicles) in the possession of the debtor hence there is no reason why the property owner should be subjected to interference or sanction.</p> \n\n<p>The Court therefore found section 114 of the Act unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed SARS to detain and sell seized property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>The core of the Constitutional Court\u2019s analysis related to the question whether section 114 of the Act infringed section 25 of the Constitution which provides for the right to property by allowing SARS to seize property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor. </p>", "topics": ["sec_25__Property_Rights"]}, {"id": "FosevMinisterofSafetyandSecurityZACCBCLRSA", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:26:24.657Z", "title": "Fose v Minister of Safety and Security [1997] ZACC 6; 1997 (7) BCLR 851; 1997 (3) SA 786", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/1997/6/eng@1997-06-05", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The applicant stated that members of the South African Police Services violated his fundamental rights through the widespread and persistent form of abuses including a series of assaults and torture over two days.

These provisions led to the disbanding of the Directorate of Special Operations, a specialised crime fighting unit located under the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and its replacement with the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), which is located within the South African Police Service (SAPS).The challenged laws were passed by Parliament and were assented to and signed by the President. The applicant challenged the constitutional validity of the laws based on the absence of a rational basis for the enactment of the laws in question. The applicant also alleged that the process of enactment failed to comply with various constitutional obligations relating to public participation, accountability, upholding international obligations, and allowing the NPA to properly exercise its functions. The High Court dismissed the constitutional challenges and held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the constitutional challenges as only the Constitutional Court had the authority to determine whether Parliament or the President had failed to fulfil their constitutional obligations. The High Court also held that the decision to disband the DSO and establish the DPCI within SAPS was aimed at enhancing the capacity of SAPS and was rational.</p>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The issue before the court was whether the national legislation that created DPCI and disbanded the DSO, is constitutionally valid. The applicant argued that the legislature violated various constitutional obligations such as the need to establish an independent crime fighting unit and to respect, protect, promote and fulfill the rights in the Bill of Rights. The amicus curiae, the Helen Suzman Foundation, argued that the constitutional obligation flows from various international treaties that South Africa ratified which required South Africa to establish an independent anti-corruption body and that the newly established DPCI, located within the SAPS, is not independent. </p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The majority judgment, penned by Moseneke DCJ and Cameron J, agreed with the minority that the applicant\u2019s rationality challenge and the allegation that Parliament failed to facilitate public involvement in the legislative process could not be upheld. The majority also agreed that section 179 of the Constitution does not oblige Parliament to locate a corruption-fighting unit only within the NPA. However, the majority disagreed with the minority view that the Constitution does not oblige the State to establish and maintain an independent corruption fighting body. The majority held that while the Constitution did not expressly demand that a corruption-fighting unit should be established, its scheme taken as a whole and international law agreements which are binding on the state imposed a pressing duty on the state to set up an effective and independent mechanism to prevent and root out corruption. The second issue considered was whether the legislation that gave effect to the DPCI met the requirements of independence and was therefore constitutionally compliant. \r\n\r\n</p><p>In considering the legislative provisions governing the DPCI, the majority held that it did not meet the constitutional requirement of appropriate independence. The reason for the majority\u2019s conclusion was that the DPCI was insufficiently protected from political influence in its structure and functioning. A key concern was the fact that policy guidelines relating to the functioning of the DPCI was to be determined by a ministerial committee which created a risk of executive and political influence on investigations and compromises the body\u2019s independence.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The majority therefore upheld the appeal and declared that the legislative provisions establishing the DPCI constitutionally invalid to the extent that they did not secure adequate independence, and suspended the declaration of constitutional invalidity for a period of eighteen months to give Parliament the opportunity to remedy the defect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minority judgment written by Ngcobo J dismissed the applicant\u2019s rationality challenge and the applicant\u2019s allegation that Parliament failed to facilitate public involvement in the legislative process. Ngcobo J held that the Constitution makes it clear that South African law must be interpreted in a manner that complies with international law. In relation to section 37 of the Constitution, Ngcobo J pointed out that section 37(4)(b)(i) requires legislation that derogates from the Bill of Rights to be \u201cconsistent with the Republic\u2019s obligations under international law applicable to states of emergency.\u201d This provision together with sections 39 and 233 of the Constitution indicate that international law has a special place in our law according to Ngcobo J.  Ngcobo J, however, held that while section 7(2) of the Constitution gives rise to an obligation on the state to fight corruption and organised crime, it did not specifically impose an obligation on the state to establish an independent corruption-fighting unit. It further held that, insofar as such a constitutional obligation is found, the structural and operational autonomy of the DPCI was secured through institutional and legal mechanisms that were adequately designed to prevent undue interference and safeguarded the independence of the DPCI.</p>\r</div>", "snippet": "<p>The issue before the court was whether the national legislation that created DPCI and disbanded the DSO, is constitutionally valid. </p>", "topics": ["sec_37__States_of_Emergency"]}, {"id": "GovernmentoftheRepublicofSouthAfricaandOthersvGrootboomandOthersZACCSABCLR", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:36:32.720Z", "title": "Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Others [2000] ZACC 19; 2001 (1) SA 46; 2000 (11) BCLR 1169\n", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2000/19/eng@2000-10-04", "facts_and_issues": "<div><p>Ms Grootboom was one of the people in a group of 510 children and 390 adults who were living in appalling circumstances in the Wallacedene informal settlement.

For a person to have access to adequate housing, the Court held that there had to be the provision of land, services (such as the provision of water, the removal of sewage and the financing of all these) and a dwelling.\r\n\r\n</p><p>The Court further held that <b>section 26</b> placed an obligation on the State and all other entities and persons to desist from preventing or impairing the right of access to adequate housing.

The program, although laudable, concentrated unduly on the goal of constructing permanent houses for as many people as possible over time, instead of providing some form of shelter for the desperate in the interim.

The Court ordered the School to amend its Code of Conduct to provide for exemption procedures allowing learners, on genuine cultural or religious grounds, to apply for permission to deviate from the uniform and other standards and requirements of the Code of Conduct, thereby allowing for the rights and interests to be weighed and balanced in the specific circumstances on a case-by-case basis.</p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court noted that whilst uniforms and school rules serve an important purpose in education, the case was not about uniforms in general, but about a specific exemption to a uniform.

On this basis, the Court rejected the suggestion that the learner could attend another school as the Constitution requires for difference to be reasonably accommodated and celebrated.

Religion is dealt with without mention of culture in <b>section 15</b>, which entrenches the right to freedom of belief and conscience. By associating religion with belief and conscience, which involve an individual\u2019s state of mind, religion is understood in an individualist sense: a set of beliefs that an individual may hold regardless of the beliefs of others. The exclusion of culture from <b>section 15</b> suggests that culture is different. The inclusion of culture in <b>section 30</b> and <b>section 31</b> makes it clear that by and large culture as conceived in our Constitution, involves associative practices and not individual beliefs. So, <b>section 31</b> speaks of the right of persons who are members of religious, linguistic or cultural communities \u201cwith other members of that community\u201d to enjoy their culture.</p> \n\n<p>However, religion, according to O\u2019Regan J, need not be associative at all. A religious belief can be entirely personal. The importance of a personal religious belief is more often than not based on a particular relationship with a deity or deities that may have little bearing on community or associative practices. Where one is dealing with personal and individualised belief, religion is to be considered differently to culture, as the Constitution makes clear. In such circumstances, it is appropriate for a court to ask whether the belief is sincerely held in order to decide whether a litigant has established that it falls within the scope of section 15. If a sincere religious belief is established, it seems correct that a court will not investigate the belief further as the cases cited by the Chief Justice in his judgment make plain. A religious belief is personal, and need not be rational, nor need it be shared by others. A court must simply be persuaded that it is a profound and sincerely held belief.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>This case concerned whether the rule prohibiting the wearing of jewellery had the potential for indirect discrimination because it allowed certain groups of learners to express their religious and cultural identity freely, while denying that right to others.</p>", "topics": ["sec_15__Freedom_of_Religion_Belief_and_Opinion", "sec_31__Cultural_Religious_and_Linguistic_Communities"]}, {"id": "MECDepartmentofAgricultureConservationandEnvironmentandAnothervHTFDevelopersPtyLimitedZACCSACCBCLRCC", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:48:59.576Z", "title": "MEC: Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment and Another v HTF Developers (Pty) Limited [2007] ZACC 25; 2008 (2) SA 319 (CC); 2008 (4) BCLR 417 (CC)", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2007/25/eng@2007-12-06", "facts_and_issues": "<div><p>The case is concerned primarily with the interaction between two sections of the Environment Conservation Act 73 of 1989 (ECA), which allowed the applicant to prevent the development of a housing estate as a result of the applicant\u2019s understanding that the development threatened the existence of certain Red Data species and naturally existing corridors that are formed by naturally formed geological ridges in Gauteng.

Transfer of any property may not be approved without a clearance certificate issued by the municipality as proof that such consumption charges have been paid. At the core of the challenge was that these provisions gave rise to arbitrary deprivation of property and violated the protection afforded in terms of <b>section 25(1) of the Constitution</b>. The South Eastern Cape Local Division of the High Court (the High Court) declared <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> unconstitutional in the Mkontwana matter and Bisset matter and these matters were referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm the confirmation of constitutional invalidity. In both these matters the Minister responsible for Local Government opposed the confirmation and appealed the High Court\u2019s order. The third matter, the Transfer Rights Action Campaign matter concerned an application for direct access to the Constitutional Court, relating to the constitutionality of national, provincial and local government legislation including <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em>.

The majority judgment by Yacoob J confirmed that these provisions are not only limited to the non-payment of consumption charges due by the owner, but also extends to the non-payment of consumption charges due by occupiers other than the owner.</p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court then turned to the question whether these provisions resulted in a deprivation of property. <b>Section 25(1)(a) of the Constitution</b> strictly provides protection against deprivation of property and provides that \u201cno law may permit arbitrary deprivation of property\u201d. The Court recognised that almost all the parties were in agreement that <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> and <b>section 50(1)(a)</b> of the <em>Ordinance</em> brought about deprivation of property. The Court dismissed the argument that these provisions were only regulatory in nature and held that a <b>\u201csubstantial interference\u201d</b> with the enjoyment or use of property that goes beyond the normal restrictions would amount to deprivation. The deprivation here was that owners were unable to transfer their properties unless consumption charges due by people other than themselves and for which they were not liable had been paid. The Court then turned to whether this deprivation was arbitrary. \n\n</p><p>The Court held that there must be <b>\u201csufficient reason\u201d</b> for the deprivation or else it would be arbitrary, and the greater the deprivation the more compelling the reason for such deprivation must be. The Court reasoned that the requirement served the important purpose of encouraging payment and considering the various categories of occupiers, the owner is usually in a position to take reasonable steps to prevent the unreasonable accumulation of outstanding consumption charges. It was therefore reasonable for the owner to bear this risk. Even in the case of unlawful occupiers, the owner is in the position to take reasonable steps to ensure it is not unlawfully occupied, by securing the property and instituting eviction proceedings to ensure such occupiers do not remain on the property for long. The deprivation in question related to one element of ownership (the right to alienate property). The Court emphasised that this was not an insubstantial deprivation as the provision requires the owner of the property to bear the risk of non-payment of consumption charges by non-owner occupiers. The Court stated that the relationship between the owner, the property and the consumption charge was sufficiently close to require the owner to bear the risk of non-payment and <b>section 118(1)</b> was not found to be arbitrary, Similarly, in cases of unlawful occupation the burden placed on the owner was held not to render <b>section 118(1)</b> arbitrary.</p>\n\n<p>The Court also held that that procedural fairness necessitates that all municipalities must, on the written request of owners, provide owners with copies of electricity and water accounts sent to occupiers.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>There were three cases before the court, and they were all concerned with the constitutional validity of laws that in effect burden owners in relation to consumption charges for water and electricity supplied to other people who occupy their immovable property. </p>", "topics": ["sec_25__Property_Rights"]}, {"id": "MlungwanaandOthersvSandAnotherZACCBCLRCCSACRCC", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:53:05.576Z", "title": "Mlungwana and Others v S and Another [2018] ZACC 45; 2019 (1) BCLR 88 (CC); 2019 (1) SACR 429 (CC)\n", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2018/45/eng@2018-11-19", "facts_and_issues": "<div><p>The matter was referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm an order of constitutional invalidity made by the High Court, Western Cape division.

This section created a criminal offence for the failure to give notice or to fail to give adequate notice to a local municipality for a gathering of more than 15 people, even if such a gathering was peaceful and unarmed. The applicants argued that such criminalisation is not constitutionally permissible because section 12(1)(a) criminalises peaceful gatherings merely because no notice was given or inadequate notice was given.</p>\n<p>The applicants travelled as a group to picket at the Cape Town Civic Centre to voice their dissatisfaction with inadequate sanitation facilities in Khayelitsha. The picket was peaceful and unarmed but grew in size at the venue as more people joined in. The applicants were then arrested and charged for contravening <strong>section 12(1)(a) of the Act</strong> and charged with the offence of failing to give notice of an assembly in terms of section 12(1)(a) of the Act. One of the defences raised by the applicants during the trial was the constitutional validity of section 12(1)(a) of the Act and the Magistrates\u2019 Court granted the applicants leave to appeal to the High Court to challenge the constitutionality of this provision. The High Court found section 12(1)(a) of the Act had a \u201cchilling\u201d and deterring effect on section 17 of the Constitution and unjustifiably limited the right.

Following a generous interpretation of section 17 of the Constitution, anything that would prevent people from assembling peacefully and unarmed would limit the right.</p>\n<p>The Court at this stage of the analysis also dismissed the respondents\u2019 claim that section 12(1)(a) of the Act merely regulates the right as the criminal sanction created by this provision is a deterrence to exercising the right enshrined in section 17 of the Constitution. The Court found that section 12(1)(a) limited section 17 of the Constitution and turned to consider whether this limitation could be justified in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>On analysing the limitation in terms of the factors listed in section 36(1) of the Constitution, the Court on considering the nature of the right, recognised that the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed is central to South Africa\u2019s constitutional democracy. The Court emphasised that the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed is a powerful tool for people who lack both political and economic power to have their voices heard and that the right enables people to exercise other constitutional rights. The Court found that there was a weak link between the criminal sanction and the achievement of section 12(1)(a)\u2019s purpose of preventing violent protests.</p>\n<p>On considering the nature and extent of the limitation, the Court held that the limitation is severe for the following reasons:</p>\n<p>i) the definitions of \u201cgatherings\u201d and \u201cconveners\u201d in the Act are overly broad;</p>\n<p>ii) criminalization can result in punishment, moral stigma, and a criminal record for at least ten years;</p>\n<p>iii) criminalisation not only has a severe impact on the person sanctioned but also has a wider far-reaching effect on those who wish to protest;</p>\n<p>iv) where there is no convener, any person who plays a role (whether it is minor or major) in planning the protest can be held criminally liable; and</p>\n<p>v) the limitation does not distinguish between adult and minor conveners.</p>\n<p>The Court held that there were other less restrictive means that could have been imposed such as administrative fines or imposing civil liability.

On the right to privacy, the Court explained that this constitutional right allows people to enjoy a degree of private intimacy and autonomy free from outside interference and that giving expression to sexuality is at the heart of this private intimacy. Any intrusion upon consensual acts which cause no harm within this sphere breaches the right to privacy.

On the municipality\u2019s version, the occupiers had been living on the land for periods ranging from two to eight years and had not applied to the municipality for housing. The occupiers  indicated that they were willing to leave the property if given reasonable notice and provided suitable alternative land to which they could move. The occupiers were told they could move to a place referred to as Walmer Township (Walmer), however they rejected the proposal saying the area was crime-ridden and over-crowded and further that they feared they would have no security of occupation there and find themselves liable to further eviction. The municipality argued that if alternative land was made available to them, they would be disrupting the housing programme and forcing the municipality to grant them preferential treatment. The Municipality applied to the South Eastern Cape Local Division of the High Court for an eviction order against the occupiers and the Court ordered the occupiers to vacate the land and authorised the Sheriff to demolish the structures. The occupiers then appealed the High Court\u2019s order to the SCA. The SCA held that the availability of alternative land was a key factor in the matter and considering that it was unclear whether Walmer was owned by the State or privately, the High Court should not have made this order without confirming whether there would be security of tenure for the occupiers when relocated.</p>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Constitutional Court had to determine whether the decision of the SCA to set aside the eviction order should be overturned.

One of the provisions of the Bill of Rights that has to be interpreted with these values in mind, is <b>section 25</b>, which provides the right to property. This matter accordingly turned on determining the constitutional relationship between <b>section 25</b> and <b>section 26</b>. Sections 25 and 26 create an overlap between land rights and socio-economic rights and it is the duty of the state to fulfil both rights. The court held that the provisions of <b>section 25, subsections 4-9</b> must be borne in mind whenever <b>section 25</b> was being construed; this is because under the Constitution, the protection of property as an individual right was not absolute but subject to societal considerations. The Court also held that the state has a duty to satisfy both property and housing rights provided for in <b>sections 25 and 26 of the Constitution and must seek to balance these rights</b> Section 26(3) of the Constitution demonstrates special constitutional consideration for a person\u2019s home and acknowledges that a home is more than just a shelter from the elements, but is also an area of personal intimacy and family security. \n\n</p><p>The Court furthermore held that the <em>Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act 19 of 1998 (PIE)</em> cannot simply be looked at as a legislative mechanism to re-establish common law property rights.

Under PIE squatting was decriminalised and evictions were subject to requirements in line with the Bill of Rights. The provisions of PIE must be considered against the values of South Africa\u2019s new constitutional dispensation. In making its decision, the court must consider all relevant circumstances, including the manner in which occupation was effected, its duration and the availability of suitable alternative accommodation or land, the motivation for settling on land, the degree of desperation of people who have sought land, and whether people occupied land with a plausible belief that they have permission to be there (as opposed to those who deliberately invade land to deliberately disrupt the organised housing programme and place themselves at the front of the queue). Regarding suitable alternative accommodation, the Court emphasised that this will vary from municipality to municipality and depends on the number of people facing eviction in each case and whether the municipality is able to secure suitable accommodation for unlawful occupiers without prejudicing the claims of lawful occupiers and those in line for formal housing.</p>\n\n<p>The Court held that considering the period which the occupiers have lived on the land, the fact that eviction is not necessary for the land to be used productively and that this is a relatively small group of people who appear to be genuinely homeless and in need, it would not be just and equitable to order the eviction.

Parliament had a wide discretion in choosing how to combat social problems, including through the creation of new offences. Furthermore, the courts must give effect to legislative choices made by Parliament except where the choices are not in line with the Constitution.

The applicants\u2019 argued that it was not rational for a convener of a gathering to take all reasonable steps to prevent an act or omission even if that act or omission was not reasonably foreseeable. Mogoeng CJ, considered the meaning of the provision and held that there is a connection between the steps that a convener takes, within its power, and preventing harm that is reasonably foreseeable. If appropriate steps are adopted when planning a gathering and these steps are reasonable to prevent foreseeable outcomes, the taking of such steps would render any act or omission that resulted in riot damage to be classified as reasonably unforeseeable. The defence was therefore found to be rational.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Mogoeng CJ, then turned to considered whether the provision limited section 17 of the Constitution. Mogoeng J held that section 11(2) of the Regulation of Gatherings Act does limit section 17 of the Constitution as it requires conveners of gatherings to adhere to the requirements and can potentially increase the cost of organising a protest which could bar under-resourced organisations from being able to protest. The question was whether this limitation could be justified in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution as a reasonable and justifiable limitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On conducting the limitation analysis in terms of section 36 of the Constitution, and looking at the importance of the right to assemble, the Court emphasised that the right to freedom of assembly is central to our constitutional democracy. It exists to give a voice to less powerful people in society and groups that do not wield political or economic power and other vulnerable persons. The right may be the only mechanism for such persons to express their concerns. Bearing in mind the significance of this right, the purpose of the limitation must be important enough to justify the limitation. The Court held that the purpose of the limitation, to protect individuals, especially those who themselves are under-resourced, who suffer damages caused by protests, is a crucial one. The Court reasoned that the public has no means to control protests whereas organisers are in a position to control and manage protests. Organizations have a choice between exercising the right to assemble or abandoning protests in order to prevent reasonably foreseeable damage. Conversely, victims of riot damage have no choice regarding what may happen to them or their property. Therefore, the Court held that the justification provided for by the law was viable and that the limitation on the right to freedom of assembly in <b>section 17 of the Constitution</b> was held to be reasonable and justifiable. The Court emphasized that the Regulation of Gatherings Act does not nullify the right to freedom of assembly, but imposes strict conditions on the right in order to prevent injury to persons or property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a concurring judgment, Jafta J held that the appeal should be dismissed, on the basis that the applicants had failed to prove that section 11(2) of the Regulations of Gatherings Act limited the right to freedom of assembly.

As a matter of logic what is bad for all children will be bad for one child in a particular case.

Kondile AJ, writing for the majority, started the equality analysis by firstly considering, whether the provision differentiated between categories of people and if there was such differentiation whether there was a legitimate rationale for such differentiation. During this first leg of the analysis, looking at the rational connection between the provision and its purpose, the Court emphasised that the private security industry was a special environment and at stake was the safety and security of the public at large. <b>Section 12 of the Constitution</b> provides everyone with the right to freedom and security of the person, which includes the right to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources. In a society rife with violent crime, the importance of protecting this right could not be exaggerated.\n\n</p><p>The majority judgment held that the regulatory scheme was carefully designed for the purpose of screening entrants to the private security industry rather than constituting a blanket ban on the registration of refugees as private security service providers. That is not to say that foreign nationals, including refugees, are inherently less trustworthy than South Africans. In a country where xenophobia has caused increased suffering, it was important to stress this and explain that it was not that the Authority did not trust refugees. The Security Act was designed to limit eligibility for registration to people whose trustworthiness could be objectively verified, and it was easier to verify the trustworthiness of citizens and permanent residents. The preamble to the Act acknowledges that the right to security of the person is fundamental to the well-being and to the social and economic development of every person. The Court therefore held that the differentiation between citizens and permanent residents on one hand and other foreigners in this instance, was rational and served a legitimate government purpose.</p> \n\n<p>On establishing differentiation, the majority judgment then considered whether the differentiation amounted to discrimination. The Court held that in this instance, the differentiation was on grounds analogous to those listed in section 9(3) of the Constitution, and therefore constituted discrimination. The analysis then turned to whether the discrimination was unfair. Various factors were considered by the Court on the question of fairness, such as the fact that  while refugees were fully entitled to work in South Africa, <b>section 22 of the Constitution</b> limited the right to choose a job to citizens only. The Court also considered that refugees could be registered as security service providers if the requirements of section 23(6) of the Security Act were met and that there was no complete exclusion of refugees from being registered. The majority found that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act did not unfairly discriminate against the applicants and was therefore constitutionally sound.</p>\n\n<p>In their dissenting judgment, Mokgoro J and O'Regan J held that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act discriminated unfairly on the basis of refugee status. The joint dissenting judgment was not convinced that the purpose identified by the Minister to ensure that security service employees were trustworthy was really intended by the section. The dissenting judgment stated that the order it would have proposed was to require that refugees who could meet the other requirements of the Security Act should not be barred from registration as security service providers. Those refugees who could not meet those requirements should seek to establish that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for them to be registered as contemplated by section 23(6) of the Security Act.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>The Constitutional Court had to determine whether the Authority\u2019s refusal to register the applicants as security service providers, on the basis that they are neither permanent residents nor citizens, was justified and whether section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act to the extent it excluded refugees from its scope constituted unfair discrimination in violation of section 9 of the Constitution.</p>", "topics": ["sec_12__Freedom_and_Security_of_the_Person"]}, {"id": "UniversityofStellenboschLegalAidClinicandOthersvMinisterofJusticeandCorrectionalServicesandOthersAssociationofDebtRecoveryAgentsNPCvUniversityofStellenboschLegalAidClinicandOthersMavavaTradingPtyLtdandOthersvUniversityofStellenboschLegalAidClinicandOthers", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T19:14:29.464Z", "title": "University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic and Others v Minister of Justice and Correctional Services and Others; Association of Debt Recovery Agents NPC v University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic and Others (CCT 127/15) [2016] ZACC 32", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2016/32/eng@2016-09-13", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The matter was referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm an order of constitutional invalidity made by the Western Cape Division of the High Court and an appeal was made against certain parts of the High Court\u2019s order.

The clients had approached a company known as SA Multiloan in Stellenbosch for small loans.

Once issued, section 65J(5) provides that the order may be executed \u2018as if it were a court judgment\u2019. The majority viewed this wording as demonstrating that the section permits execution without judicial oversight. The majority judgment concluded that the language of the provision clearly shows that it permitted judicially unsanctioned enforcement of judgment debts and was therefore unconstitutional, holding that a debtor\u2019s section 34 right of access to court is breached when an execution process against any form of property occurs without judicial oversight by a court.

This Proclamation governed the setting-up of special African townships by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in areas under the African Native Trust. This Proclamation was one of the tools with which the apartheid state disposed Africans from landholding and created barriers to Africans owning any land. Instead, Africans could only hold rights to the lands through an insecure tenure system of Deeds of Grant and Certificates of Occupancy and letting for residential purposes. The township manager had the authority to cancel this tenure at any point. Special deeds registries were created to register the deeds of grant under the legislation.</p>\n<p>When South Africa transitioned to democratic majority rule, the President, empowered by the Interim Constitution, passed Proclamation R9 of 1997 together with amendments to the Deeds Registry Act. The impact of these changes was to regularise and create a more uniform approach to registration of titles in immovable property. The President also delegated certain legislative competencies to the provincial legislations to ensure multi-level governance.\u00a0<br>Consequently, the North West passed the North West Act 7 which supposedly repealed the whole of Proclamation R293.

The applicants argued that neither of these categories of persons were able to retain or obtain South African citizenship following the 2010 Amendment.

Interrelated to this question was whether the phrase \u2018any person who is born\u2019 in section 2(1)(b) meant that the section applied only to future persons born to South African citizens, or whether it could be interpreted to include past births too. </p> If the section only applied to future cases, it would have deprived people entitled to citizenship by descent under the previous version of the Citizenship Act merely because they were born before 1 January 2013. \n</div>", "interpretation": "<div><p>Section 2(1) of the 2010 Amendment classifies a citizen as any person who: </p><p>(a) who immediately prior to the commencement of the 2010 Amendment was a South African citizen  by birth  (i.e. immediately  prior to 1 January 2013); or</p> <p>(b) who is born in or outside of South Africa to a South African citizen.</p>\n\n<p>The Constitutional Court interpreted <b>section 2(1)(a) and (b) of the amended Citizenship Act</b> in a way that it did not arbitrarily deprive persons of their citizenship overnight. The Constitutional Court held that it was clear that section 2(1)(a) retains citizenship only for those who were considered \u201ccitizens by birth\u201d before the commencement of the 2010 Amendment. This could create an anomaly as persons who acquired citizenship by descent under the previous version of the Citizenship Act would now be excluded. This apparent exclusion could be resolved by adopting a purposive interpretation of section 2(1)(b). \n\n</p><p>The Court interpreted the term \u2018is born\u2019 in section 2(1)(b) as a \u201cstate of being\u201d not indicative of a tense, but rather including all persons regardless of when they were born. The Court held that this was a reasonable and constitutionally compliant interpretation which meant that section 2 was applicable to persons born to a South African parent before and after 1 January 2013, curing the anomaly. </p> This interpretation allowed for all categories of citizens who acquired citizenship by birth or descent in terms of the previous version of the Citizenship Act to be included. As the 2010 Amendment could be interpreted in a constitutionally compliant manner, the findings of invalidity in the High Court were not confirmed by the Constitutional Court. \n\n<p>The Constitutional Court thereby ensured that the sections of the 2010 Amendment would be interpreted and applied consistently with <b>section 20 of the Constitution</b>.</p> \n\n<p>(i) On section 20 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court held that although the importance of citizenship should not be overemphasised, citizenship is a gateway right to many other constitutional rights \u2013 namely, freedom of movement, freedom of trade and political rights, and is more than a legal status. Citizenship related to the core of a person\u2019s identity, a sense of belonging in a community and to security of a person most especially in communities rife with xenophobia. Deprivation of, or interference with, a person\u2019s citizenship status affects their private and family life, their choices concerning where establish their homes, apply for jobs, enrol in schools; whether they can form part of the community; their ability to participate fully in the political activity and governance; and the extent to which they may exercise freedom of movement.</p>\n\n<p>(ii) The Constitutional Court held that whilst certain rights in the Constitution are only available to South African citizens, drawing arbitrary and irrational distinctions between citizens and non-citizens through legislation or decision-making is inconsistent with the Constitution. </p>\n\n<p>(iii) Legislation must be interpreted to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, but any interpretation must remain consistent with the text of the legislation.

The Constitutional Court adopted an interpretation that was consistent with and promoted both the text of the section (by recognising that the section\u2019s language is not time-specific but rather linked to a condition of having been born) as well as the Bill of Rights (not to arbitrarily deprive persons of their citizenship overnight, as required by section 20 linked to other constitutional rights).</p>\n</div>", "snippet": "<p>The Court had to determine whether section 2(1)(a) and (b) of the South African Citizenship Act 88 of 1995 (the \u201cCitizenship Act\u201d), as amended by the South African Citizenship Amendment Act 17 of 2010 (the \u201c2010 Amendment\u201d), was unconstitutional and invalid.\n</p>", "topics": ["sec_20__Citizenship", "sec_3__Citizenship"]}, {"id": "CityofJohannesburgMetropolitanMunicipalityvBlueMoonlightPropertiesPtyLtdandAnotherCCZACCBCLRCCSACC", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T15:45:56.721Z", "title": "City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality v Blue Moonlight Properties 39 (Pty) Ltd and Another (CC) [2011] ZACC 33; 2012 (2) BCLR 150 (CC); 2012 (2) SA 104 (CC)\n", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2011/33/eng@2011-12-01", "facts_and_issues": "<div><p>This case concerns the conflict between the constitutional right to adequate housing in terms of section 26(2) of the Constitution and a property owner\u2019s right to develop private property.  86 indigent individuals were unlawfully occupying private unused industrial facilities as living quarters. The owner of the property (Blue Moonlight) approached the South Gauteng High Court, Johannesburg seeking an order to evict the occupiers in order to develop the property. The occupiers opposed the eviction on the basis that it would almost certainly render them homeless and argued that the City of Johannesburg (the City)  had an obligation to provide them with temporary housing under the Constitution and the <b>Prevention of Illegal Eviction and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act, 19 of 1998 (PIE)</b> before they could be evicted.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>The High Court granted the eviction order, but also ordered the City to remedy its housing policy as it was found to be unconstitutional and the High Court issued a structural interdict against the City obliging the City to report back to the High Court on the steps taken remedying its housing policy. The City was also ordered to provide temporary housing to the occupiers and to pay Blue Moonlight compensation until the eviction date. The City subsequently appealed the High Court\u2019s order to  the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). The SCA only set aside the structural interdict against the City and the High Court\u2019s compensation order and declared the City\u2019s housing policy unconstitutional to the extent that it excluded the occupiers from temporary housing and the City was ordered to provide them with \u201ctemporary emergency accommodation\u201d.

The City argued that it was neither obliged nor able to provide emergency accommodation in these circumstances and that its role in this regard was secondary. The City argued that local government does not have a primary role in fulfilling the right to access to adequate housing and that this mandate falls on the shoulders of the national and provincial government. The City argued that it fulfilled its duties after requesting assistance from provincial government and no more could be expected from it. The occupiers opposed the City\u2019s appeal and also applied for a conditional cross-appeal requesting that an order of eviction be linked to the condition that suitable alternative accommodation be provided and that the City report back on steps taken to remedying its housing policy.</p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>In a unanimous judgment by Van der Westhuizen J, the Court held that an owner's constitutional right not to be deprived of property must be interpreted in the social and historical context and be balanced against the right of access to adequate housing and not to be evicted arbitrarily from one's home. The Court emphasised that apartheid legislation undermined both the right of access to adequate housing and the right to property. Section 25 prohibits arbitrary deprivation of property, but also undertakes to redress unequal social conditions.</p>  Section 26 of the Constitution \u201chighlights the transformative vision of the Constitution\u201d and PIE was enacted to specifically prevent the historical abuse of displacement of people. In this case, even though housing unlawful occupiers indefinitely suspends an owner's right to use and enjoy property, evictions can only be carried out in terms of PIE. PIE allows for the eviction of unlawful occupiers only in circumstances where such eviction is just and equitable.\r\n\r\n<p>In deciding whether an eviction is just and equitable in terms of PIE, the Court considered that many of the occupiers had lived on the property for a very long time, the occupation had once been lawful, Blue Moonlight was aware of the occupiers\u2019 presence when it purchased the property, and the eviction of the occupiers would render them homeless while there was no competing risk of homelessness on the part of Blue Moonlight. Furthermore, the Court held that a key consideration was whether the City had made reasonable efforts to provide alternative accommodation to the occupiers. After considering the City\u2019s housing policy, the Court noted that the policy differentiated between persons relocated by the City itself and those evicted by private landowners. However, where relocation was sought by the City, these persons were housed in temporary accommodation, which was not the case with persons evicted by private landowners.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Court emphasised that section 26(2) of the Constitution recognises that the state is constrained by resources in giving effect to the right to adequate housing and therefore a housing policy may differentiate and give preference to categories of people; however any differentiation must be rational. The City\u2019s housing policy was found to be \u201crigid\u201d. The Court held that the policy failed to take into account whether emergency accommodation should be made available in individual cases, considering the categories of persons affected (such as elderly people and children) and their circumstances, and that an imminent eviction might render them homeless, regardless of whether the eviction or relocation is sought by the City or a private landowner. The Court held that this differentiation was not rational. Where an eviction may result in homelessness, it is irrelevant whether such eviction is at the instance of the City or a private landowner. The Court emphasised that this matter concerns \u201ctemporary\u201d accommodation in an emergency as defined in Chapter 12 of the National Housing Code and not \u201cpermanent\u201d housing. The obligation, while derived from the right to progressive realisation of adequate housing in terms of <b>section 26(2) of the Constitution</b>, is distinct from the obligation to address permanent housing needs.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The Court therefore declared the City\u2019s housing policy unconstitutional and in violation of section 26 of the Constitution to the extent that it excluded people evicted by private landowners from its temporary housing programme. The Court dismissed the City\u2019s appeal and held that the occupiers had to vacate the properties by a given date. The Court stipulated that the City was to provide the evictees with \"temporary accommodation in a location as near as feasibly possible to the area\" in which the building was situated, in order to ensure that the occupiers were not rendered homeless between the date of eviction and the date by which the City would have to provide emergency housing.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>The Court considered whether the 86 occupiers must be evicted to allow the owner to fully exercise its rights regarding its property and, if so, whether their eviction must be linked to an order that the City provide them with accommodation. </p>", "topics": ["sec_26__Housing"]}, {"id": "ConstitutionalityoftheMpumalangaPetitionsBillZACCSACCBCLR", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:23:15.823Z", "title": "Constitutionality of the Mpumalanga Petitions Bill, 2000 [2001] ZACC 10; 2002 (1) SA 447 (CC); 2001 (11) BCLR 1126", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2001/10/eng@2001-10-05", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The Premier of Mpumalanga, acting under section 121 of the Constitution, referred the Mpumalanga Petitions Bill to the Constitutional Court so they could decide on the constitutionality of the Bill because he had two reservations about its constitutionality. </p>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The first issue that the Premier raised was whether the legislature was permitted by <b>the Constitution</b> to pass the Petitions Bill.

Ms Daniels obtained interim order from the Stellenbosch Magistrate\u2019s Court for the restoration of her undisturbed occupation on the farm and required Mr Scribante to repair and replace the door and restore the electricity supply. Mr Scribante then ceased to maintain the dwelling. The dwelling required improvements which would enable it to be fit for human living. These included levelling the floors, paving part of the outside area and the installation of an indoor water supply, a wash basin, a second window and a ceiling.

The Court held that whether private persons will be bound by section 8(2) depends on a number of factors:</p>\r\n<p>(i)\tWhat is the nature of the right? (Is the obligation positive or negative? That is, does the obligation require something to be done, or for the party to abstain from doing something?)</p>\r\n<p>(ii)\tWhat is the history of the right?</p>\r\n<p>(iii)\tWhat does the right seek to achieve?</p>\r\n<p>(iv)\tHow best can that be chieved?</p>\r\n<p>(v)\tWhat is the \u201cpotential of invasion of that right by persons other than the State or organs of State?</p>\r\n<p>(vi)\tWould letting private persons off the net not negate the essential content of the right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madlanga J stressed that after weighing up these factors one concludes that private persons are bound and must bear a positive obligation, then such an obligation must be imposed and <b>section 8(2)</b> does envisage that such obligation can be imposed.

The decisive question is whether private persons should be bound by the right in the Bill of Rights. In relation to security of tenure, the duty (both positive and negative) imposed by the right to security of tenure does in fact rest on private persons. People in need of protection under ESTA often reside on land owned by private persons, as in this case. The obligation resting on an owner is a positive one. A private party is required by <b>section 25(6) of the Constitution</b> through ESTA to accommodate another on their land.

This is because Part A of Schedule 5 of the Constitution lists the functional areas of exclusive provincial legislative competence and the fifth item is \u2018liquor licences\u2019. The President believed that the inclusion of this item meant that Parliament may, in terms of section 44(2) of the Constitution only intervene by passing legislation with regard to a matter falling within a functional area listed in Schedule 5, when it is necessary in certain prescribed circumstances.

The Minister argued further that even if the Bill infringed on the provinces\u2019 exclusive powers it was justified in terms of <b>section 44(2) of the Constitution</b>.

Cameron J explained that where it is evident that the matter requires regulation inter-provincially (between provinces) as opposed to intra-provincially (within a single province), then the matter will fall within Schedule 4. Where provinces are given exclusive powers in Schedule 5, these apply to matters which can be regulated intra-provincially. Cameron J formulated the \u201cpith and substance\u201d test for determining legislative competence, which looks at whether the substance of the Bill falls within Schedule 4 or 5.

It was held that the substance of the Bill was directed at three objectives. Firstly, the prohibition of cross-holdings between producers, distributors and retailers, and this was held to be an exclusive national competence. Secondly, the establishment of uniform conditions for national registration of manufacturers and distributors. Here it was held that provincial exclusive competence in relation to liquor licenses was not intended to cover the manufacturing and distribution of liquor because this was not an intra-provincial activity and was therefore an exclusive national competence. The third objective was to prescribe detailed mechanisms to provincial legislators for establishing retail licensing mechanisms. This was found to be an exclusive provincial competence under Schedule 5, which was liquor licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cameron J interpreted \u201cliquor licenses\u201d in Part A of Schedule 5 as referring to intra-provincial liquor licenses, but he found that even if exclusive provincial competence in respect of liquor licenses did extend to the manufacturing and distribution, national government\u2019s interest in maintaining economic unity would enable national government to intervene in terms of Section 44(2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court concluded that the Liquor Bill was unconstitutional. In terms of Section 44(2), the national government was justified in intervening and creating a national system of registration for manufacturers and distributors and in prohibiting cross-holdings.

The provinces argued that the declaration of metropolitan areas is a provincial power which is incidental to the power to establish municipalities.

The Court rejected this argument by holding that a district management area is part of a district municipality and not a separate municipality. The Court found that the establishment of district management areas impacts on the boundaries of municipalities and is accordingly a function to be performed by the Demarcation Board.

The Court held that validity of legislation that gives the executive wide powers must be considered against the Constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers. By considering various foreign law approaches, the Court noted that Commonwealth countries had a clear separation of power when it came to the judiciary but that the separation between the legislature and executive is not as well defined.

The Court held that deviation from these constitutional requirements could potentially only be justified in exceptional circumstances such as war or under a state of emergency.

The Court then considered the alternative main argument that section 417 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 infringed sections 11 and 13 of the Interim Constitution.

Accordingly, in this case, the Court analysed firstly whether section 417(2)(b) of the Companies Act limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>, relating to the right to freedom and security of the person. The Court emphasised that a broad interpretation should be given to the right at this stage as the second stage of the limitation test involving <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> prescribes the criteria that has to be met before an entrenched right can be justifiably limited. The Court held that section 417(2)(b) limited <b>section 11(1) of the Interim Constitution</b> and then turned to the second stage of the limitation test. The second stage involved analysing whether this limitation could be justified as reasonable in a democratic society taking into account the prescribed factors in <b>section 33(1) of the Interim Constitution</b>.

FNB argued that the detention and sale by SARS in terms of section 114 where FNB was the owner of the motor vehicles but was not a customs debtor amounted to expropriation of the motor vehicles in terms of section 25. As FNB was not compensated for such expropriation as required in terms of section 25(2)(b) of the Constitution, FNB argued that that section 114 breached section 25(1) which provides that \u201cno one may be deprived of property, except in terms of law of general application and no law may permit arbitrary deprivation\u201d. </p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court in its analysis on the constitutional challenge to section 25 firstly analysed the meaning of section 25 and held that the provision mainly enshrines a negative protection of property.

The Court held that the deprivation is arbitrary \u201cwhen the \u2018law\u2019 referred to in section 25(1) does not provide sufficient reason for the particular deprivation in question or is procedurally unfair\u201d. The Court also gave a list of factors to be taken into account to determine whether there is \u2018sufficient reason\u2019, such as the nature and complexity of the relationship between the means and ends; and the nature or type of the right or property in question (i.e. ownership in land or other extensive property rights will require more justification in order to be sufficient).</p>\n\n<p>Following this analysis, the Court held that section 114 of the Act deprived FNB permanently of all its rights and benefits as owner of the vehicles. On applying the test for whether the deprivation was arbitrary or not, and therefore whether the deprivation was constitutional or not, the Court concluded that the deprivation, the seizure by SARS under section 114 of FNB\u2019s vehicles, was arbitrary and unconstitutional because there was insufficient reason justifying it. The Court held that: (i) there was no connection between the debt of the debtors and the owner of the property (FNB); (ii) there was no connection between the debt and the property (FNB\u2019s vehicles); (iii) the property owner (FNB) did not detriment SARS by placing the property (the vehicles) in the possession of the debtor hence there is no reason why the property owner should be subjected to interference or sanction.</p> \n\n<p>The Court therefore found section 114 of the Act unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed SARS to detain and sell seized property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>The core of the Constitutional Court\u2019s analysis related to the question whether section 114 of the Act infringed section 25 of the Constitution which provides for the right to property by allowing SARS to seize property owned by a third party from a debtor in order to satisfy the debts of the debtor. </p>", "topics": ["sec_25__Property_Rights"]}, {"id": "FosevMinisterofSafetyandSecurityZACCBCLRSA", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:26:24.657Z", "title": "Fose v Minister of Safety and Security [1997] ZACC 6; 1997 (7) BCLR 851; 1997 (3) SA 786", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/1997/6/eng@1997-06-05", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The applicant stated that members of the South African Police Services violated his fundamental rights through the widespread and persistent form of abuses including a series of assaults and torture over two days.

These provisions led to the disbanding of the Directorate of Special Operations, a specialised crime fighting unit located under the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and its replacement with the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), which is located within the South African Police Service (SAPS).The challenged laws were passed by Parliament and were assented to and signed by the President. The applicant challenged the constitutional validity of the laws based on the absence of a rational basis for the enactment of the laws in question. The applicant also alleged that the process of enactment failed to comply with various constitutional obligations relating to public participation, accountability, upholding international obligations, and allowing the NPA to properly exercise its functions. The High Court dismissed the constitutional challenges and held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the constitutional challenges as only the Constitutional Court had the authority to determine whether Parliament or the President had failed to fulfil their constitutional obligations. The High Court also held that the decision to disband the DSO and establish the DPCI within SAPS was aimed at enhancing the capacity of SAPS and was rational.</p>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The issue before the court was whether the national legislation that created DPCI and disbanded the DSO, is constitutionally valid. The applicant argued that the legislature violated various constitutional obligations such as the need to establish an independent crime fighting unit and to respect, protect, promote and fulfill the rights in the Bill of Rights. The amicus curiae, the Helen Suzman Foundation, argued that the constitutional obligation flows from various international treaties that South Africa ratified which required South Africa to establish an independent anti-corruption body and that the newly established DPCI, located within the SAPS, is not independent. </p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The majority judgment, penned by Moseneke DCJ and Cameron J, agreed with the minority that the applicant\u2019s rationality challenge and the allegation that Parliament failed to facilitate public involvement in the legislative process could not be upheld. The majority also agreed that section 179 of the Constitution does not oblige Parliament to locate a corruption-fighting unit only within the NPA. However, the majority disagreed with the minority view that the Constitution does not oblige the State to establish and maintain an independent corruption fighting body. The majority held that while the Constitution did not expressly demand that a corruption-fighting unit should be established, its scheme taken as a whole and international law agreements which are binding on the state imposed a pressing duty on the state to set up an effective and independent mechanism to prevent and root out corruption. The second issue considered was whether the legislation that gave effect to the DPCI met the requirements of independence and was therefore constitutionally compliant. \r\n\r\n</p><p>In considering the legislative provisions governing the DPCI, the majority held that it did not meet the constitutional requirement of appropriate independence. The reason for the majority\u2019s conclusion was that the DPCI was insufficiently protected from political influence in its structure and functioning. A key concern was the fact that policy guidelines relating to the functioning of the DPCI was to be determined by a ministerial committee which created a risk of executive and political influence on investigations and compromises the body\u2019s independence.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The majority therefore upheld the appeal and declared that the legislative provisions establishing the DPCI constitutionally invalid to the extent that they did not secure adequate independence, and suspended the declaration of constitutional invalidity for a period of eighteen months to give Parliament the opportunity to remedy the defect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minority judgment written by Ngcobo J dismissed the applicant\u2019s rationality challenge and the applicant\u2019s allegation that Parliament failed to facilitate public involvement in the legislative process. Ngcobo J held that the Constitution makes it clear that South African law must be interpreted in a manner that complies with international law. In relation to section 37 of the Constitution, Ngcobo J pointed out that section 37(4)(b)(i) requires legislation that derogates from the Bill of Rights to be \u201cconsistent with the Republic\u2019s obligations under international law applicable to states of emergency.\u201d This provision together with sections 39 and 233 of the Constitution indicate that international law has a special place in our law according to Ngcobo J.  Ngcobo J, however, held that while section 7(2) of the Constitution gives rise to an obligation on the state to fight corruption and organised crime, it did not specifically impose an obligation on the state to establish an independent corruption-fighting unit. It further held that, insofar as such a constitutional obligation is found, the structural and operational autonomy of the DPCI was secured through institutional and legal mechanisms that were adequately designed to prevent undue interference and safeguarded the independence of the DPCI.</p>\r</div>", "snippet": "<p>The issue before the court was whether the national legislation that created DPCI and disbanded the DSO, is constitutionally valid. </p>", "topics": ["sec_37__States_of_Emergency"]}, {"id": "GovernmentoftheRepublicofSouthAfricaandOthersvGrootboomandOthersZACCSABCLR", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:36:32.720Z", "title": "Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Others [2000] ZACC 19; 2001 (1) SA 46; 2000 (11) BCLR 1169\n", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2000/19/eng@2000-10-04", "facts_and_issues": "<div><p>Ms Grootboom was one of the people in a group of 510 children and 390 adults who were living in appalling circumstances in the Wallacedene informal settlement.

For a person to have access to adequate housing, the Court held that there had to be the provision of land, services (such as the provision of water, the removal of sewage and the financing of all these) and a dwelling.\r\n\r\n</p><p>The Court further held that <b>section 26</b> placed an obligation on the State and all other entities and persons to desist from preventing or impairing the right of access to adequate housing.

The program, although laudable, concentrated unduly on the goal of constructing permanent houses for as many people as possible over time, instead of providing some form of shelter for the desperate in the interim.

The Court ordered the School to amend its Code of Conduct to provide for exemption procedures allowing learners, on genuine cultural or religious grounds, to apply for permission to deviate from the uniform and other standards and requirements of the Code of Conduct, thereby allowing for the rights and interests to be weighed and balanced in the specific circumstances on a case-by-case basis.</p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court noted that whilst uniforms and school rules serve an important purpose in education, the case was not about uniforms in general, but about a specific exemption to a uniform.

On this basis, the Court rejected the suggestion that the learner could attend another school as the Constitution requires for difference to be reasonably accommodated and celebrated.

Religion is dealt with without mention of culture in <b>section 15</b>, which entrenches the right to freedom of belief and conscience. By associating religion with belief and conscience, which involve an individual\u2019s state of mind, religion is understood in an individualist sense: a set of beliefs that an individual may hold regardless of the beliefs of others. The exclusion of culture from <b>section 15</b> suggests that culture is different. The inclusion of culture in <b>section 30</b> and <b>section 31</b> makes it clear that by and large culture as conceived in our Constitution, involves associative practices and not individual beliefs. So, <b>section 31</b> speaks of the right of persons who are members of religious, linguistic or cultural communities \u201cwith other members of that community\u201d to enjoy their culture.</p> \n\n<p>However, religion, according to O\u2019Regan J, need not be associative at all. A religious belief can be entirely personal. The importance of a personal religious belief is more often than not based on a particular relationship with a deity or deities that may have little bearing on community or associative practices. Where one is dealing with personal and individualised belief, religion is to be considered differently to culture, as the Constitution makes clear. In such circumstances, it is appropriate for a court to ask whether the belief is sincerely held in order to decide whether a litigant has established that it falls within the scope of section 15. If a sincere religious belief is established, it seems correct that a court will not investigate the belief further as the cases cited by the Chief Justice in his judgment make plain. A religious belief is personal, and need not be rational, nor need it be shared by others. A court must simply be persuaded that it is a profound and sincerely held belief.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>This case concerned whether the rule prohibiting the wearing of jewellery had the potential for indirect discrimination because it allowed certain groups of learners to express their religious and cultural identity freely, while denying that right to others.</p>", "topics": ["sec_15__Freedom_of_Religion_Belief_and_Opinion", "sec_31__Cultural_Religious_and_Linguistic_Communities"]}, {"id": "MECDepartmentofAgricultureConservationandEnvironmentandAnothervHTFDevelopersPtyLimitedZACCSACCBCLRCC", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:48:59.576Z", "title": "MEC: Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment and Another v HTF Developers (Pty) Limited [2007] ZACC 25; 2008 (2) SA 319 (CC); 2008 (4) BCLR 417 (CC)", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2007/25/eng@2007-12-06", "facts_and_issues": "<div><p>The case is concerned primarily with the interaction between two sections of the Environment Conservation Act 73 of 1989 (ECA), which allowed the applicant to prevent the development of a housing estate as a result of the applicant\u2019s understanding that the development threatened the existence of certain Red Data species and naturally existing corridors that are formed by naturally formed geological ridges in Gauteng.

Transfer of any property may not be approved without a clearance certificate issued by the municipality as proof that such consumption charges have been paid. At the core of the challenge was that these provisions gave rise to arbitrary deprivation of property and violated the protection afforded in terms of <b>section 25(1) of the Constitution</b>. The South Eastern Cape Local Division of the High Court (the High Court) declared <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> unconstitutional in the Mkontwana matter and Bisset matter and these matters were referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm the confirmation of constitutional invalidity. In both these matters the Minister responsible for Local Government opposed the confirmation and appealed the High Court\u2019s order. The third matter, the Transfer Rights Action Campaign matter concerned an application for direct access to the Constitutional Court, relating to the constitutionality of national, provincial and local government legislation including <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em>.

The majority judgment by Yacoob J confirmed that these provisions are not only limited to the non-payment of consumption charges due by the owner, but also extends to the non-payment of consumption charges due by occupiers other than the owner.</p>", "interpretation": "<div><p>The Court then turned to the question whether these provisions resulted in a deprivation of property. <b>Section 25(1)(a) of the Constitution</b> strictly provides protection against deprivation of property and provides that \u201cno law may permit arbitrary deprivation of property\u201d. The Court recognised that almost all the parties were in agreement that <b>section 118(1)</b> of the <em>Municipal Systems Act</em> and <b>section 50(1)(a)</b> of the <em>Ordinance</em> brought about deprivation of property. The Court dismissed the argument that these provisions were only regulatory in nature and held that a <b>\u201csubstantial interference\u201d</b> with the enjoyment or use of property that goes beyond the normal restrictions would amount to deprivation. The deprivation here was that owners were unable to transfer their properties unless consumption charges due by people other than themselves and for which they were not liable had been paid. The Court then turned to whether this deprivation was arbitrary. \n\n</p><p>The Court held that there must be <b>\u201csufficient reason\u201d</b> for the deprivation or else it would be arbitrary, and the greater the deprivation the more compelling the reason for such deprivation must be. The Court reasoned that the requirement served the important purpose of encouraging payment and considering the various categories of occupiers, the owner is usually in a position to take reasonable steps to prevent the unreasonable accumulation of outstanding consumption charges. It was therefore reasonable for the owner to bear this risk. Even in the case of unlawful occupiers, the owner is in the position to take reasonable steps to ensure it is not unlawfully occupied, by securing the property and instituting eviction proceedings to ensure such occupiers do not remain on the property for long. The deprivation in question related to one element of ownership (the right to alienate property). The Court emphasised that this was not an insubstantial deprivation as the provision requires the owner of the property to bear the risk of non-payment of consumption charges by non-owner occupiers. The Court stated that the relationship between the owner, the property and the consumption charge was sufficiently close to require the owner to bear the risk of non-payment and <b>section 118(1)</b> was not found to be arbitrary, Similarly, in cases of unlawful occupation the burden placed on the owner was held not to render <b>section 118(1)</b> arbitrary.</p>\n\n<p>The Court also held that that procedural fairness necessitates that all municipalities must, on the written request of owners, provide owners with copies of electricity and water accounts sent to occupiers.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>There were three cases before the court, and they were all concerned with the constitutional validity of laws that in effect burden owners in relation to consumption charges for water and electricity supplied to other people who occupy their immovable property. </p>", "topics": ["sec_25__Property_Rights"]}, {"id": "MlungwanaandOthersvSandAnotherZACCBCLRCCSACRCC", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T17:53:05.576Z", "title": "Mlungwana and Others v S and Another [2018] ZACC 45; 2019 (1) BCLR 88 (CC); 2019 (1) SACR 429 (CC)\n", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2018/45/eng@2018-11-19", "facts_and_issues": "<div><p>The matter was referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm an order of constitutional invalidity made by the High Court, Western Cape division.

This section created a criminal offence for the failure to give notice or to fail to give adequate notice to a local municipality for a gathering of more than 15 people, even if such a gathering was peaceful and unarmed. The applicants argued that such criminalisation is not constitutionally permissible because section 12(1)(a) criminalises peaceful gatherings merely because no notice was given or inadequate notice was given.</p>\n<p>The applicants travelled as a group to picket at the Cape Town Civic Centre to voice their dissatisfaction with inadequate sanitation facilities in Khayelitsha. The picket was peaceful and unarmed but grew in size at the venue as more people joined in. The applicants were then arrested and charged for contravening <strong>section 12(1)(a) of the Act</strong> and charged with the offence of failing to give notice of an assembly in terms of section 12(1)(a) of the Act. One of the defences raised by the applicants during the trial was the constitutional validity of section 12(1)(a) of the Act and the Magistrates\u2019 Court granted the applicants leave to appeal to the High Court to challenge the constitutionality of this provision. The High Court found section 12(1)(a) of the Act had a \u201cchilling\u201d and deterring effect on section 17 of the Constitution and unjustifiably limited the right.

Following a generous interpretation of section 17 of the Constitution, anything that would prevent people from assembling peacefully and unarmed would limit the right.</p>\n<p>The Court at this stage of the analysis also dismissed the respondents\u2019 claim that section 12(1)(a) of the Act merely regulates the right as the criminal sanction created by this provision is a deterrence to exercising the right enshrined in section 17 of the Constitution. The Court found that section 12(1)(a) limited section 17 of the Constitution and turned to consider whether this limitation could be justified in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>On analysing the limitation in terms of the factors listed in section 36(1) of the Constitution, the Court on considering the nature of the right, recognised that the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed is central to South Africa\u2019s constitutional democracy. The Court emphasised that the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed is a powerful tool for people who lack both political and economic power to have their voices heard and that the right enables people to exercise other constitutional rights. The Court found that there was a weak link between the criminal sanction and the achievement of section 12(1)(a)\u2019s purpose of preventing violent protests.</p>\n<p>On considering the nature and extent of the limitation, the Court held that the limitation is severe for the following reasons:</p>\n<p>i) the definitions of \u201cgatherings\u201d and \u201cconveners\u201d in the Act are overly broad;</p>\n<p>ii) criminalization can result in punishment, moral stigma, and a criminal record for at least ten years;</p>\n<p>iii) criminalisation not only has a severe impact on the person sanctioned but also has a wider far-reaching effect on those who wish to protest;</p>\n<p>iv) where there is no convener, any person who plays a role (whether it is minor or major) in planning the protest can be held criminally liable; and</p>\n<p>v) the limitation does not distinguish between adult and minor conveners.</p>\n<p>The Court held that there were other less restrictive means that could have been imposed such as administrative fines or imposing civil liability.

On the right to privacy, the Court explained that this constitutional right allows people to enjoy a degree of private intimacy and autonomy free from outside interference and that giving expression to sexuality is at the heart of this private intimacy. Any intrusion upon consensual acts which cause no harm within this sphere breaches the right to privacy.

On the municipality\u2019s version, the occupiers had been living on the land for periods ranging from two to eight years and had not applied to the municipality for housing. The occupiers  indicated that they were willing to leave the property if given reasonable notice and provided suitable alternative land to which they could move. The occupiers were told they could move to a place referred to as Walmer Township (Walmer), however they rejected the proposal saying the area was crime-ridden and over-crowded and further that they feared they would have no security of occupation there and find themselves liable to further eviction. The municipality argued that if alternative land was made available to them, they would be disrupting the housing programme and forcing the municipality to grant them preferential treatment. The Municipality applied to the South Eastern Cape Local Division of the High Court for an eviction order against the occupiers and the Court ordered the occupiers to vacate the land and authorised the Sheriff to demolish the structures. The occupiers then appealed the High Court\u2019s order to the SCA. The SCA held that the availability of alternative land was a key factor in the matter and considering that it was unclear whether Walmer was owned by the State or privately, the High Court should not have made this order without confirming whether there would be security of tenure for the occupiers when relocated.</p>", "right_and_principle": "<p>The Constitutional Court had to determine whether the decision of the SCA to set aside the eviction order should be overturned.

One of the provisions of the Bill of Rights that has to be interpreted with these values in mind, is <b>section 25</b>, which provides the right to property. This matter accordingly turned on determining the constitutional relationship between <b>section 25</b> and <b>section 26</b>. Sections 25 and 26 create an overlap between land rights and socio-economic rights and it is the duty of the state to fulfil both rights. The court held that the provisions of <b>section 25, subsections 4-9</b> must be borne in mind whenever <b>section 25</b> was being construed; this is because under the Constitution, the protection of property as an individual right was not absolute but subject to societal considerations. The Court also held that the state has a duty to satisfy both property and housing rights provided for in <b>sections 25 and 26 of the Constitution and must seek to balance these rights</b> Section 26(3) of the Constitution demonstrates special constitutional consideration for a person\u2019s home and acknowledges that a home is more than just a shelter from the elements, but is also an area of personal intimacy and family security. \n\n</p><p>The Court furthermore held that the <em>Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act 19 of 1998 (PIE)</em> cannot simply be looked at as a legislative mechanism to re-establish common law property rights.

Under PIE squatting was decriminalised and evictions were subject to requirements in line with the Bill of Rights. The provisions of PIE must be considered against the values of South Africa\u2019s new constitutional dispensation. In making its decision, the court must consider all relevant circumstances, including the manner in which occupation was effected, its duration and the availability of suitable alternative accommodation or land, the motivation for settling on land, the degree of desperation of people who have sought land, and whether people occupied land with a plausible belief that they have permission to be there (as opposed to those who deliberately invade land to deliberately disrupt the organised housing programme and place themselves at the front of the queue). Regarding suitable alternative accommodation, the Court emphasised that this will vary from municipality to municipality and depends on the number of people facing eviction in each case and whether the municipality is able to secure suitable accommodation for unlawful occupiers without prejudicing the claims of lawful occupiers and those in line for formal housing.</p>\n\n<p>The Court held that considering the period which the occupiers have lived on the land, the fact that eviction is not necessary for the land to be used productively and that this is a relatively small group of people who appear to be genuinely homeless and in need, it would not be just and equitable to order the eviction.

Parliament had a wide discretion in choosing how to combat social problems, including through the creation of new offences. Furthermore, the courts must give effect to legislative choices made by Parliament except where the choices are not in line with the Constitution.

The applicants\u2019 argued that it was not rational for a convener of a gathering to take all reasonable steps to prevent an act or omission even if that act or omission was not reasonably foreseeable. Mogoeng CJ, considered the meaning of the provision and held that there is a connection between the steps that a convener takes, within its power, and preventing harm that is reasonably foreseeable. If appropriate steps are adopted when planning a gathering and these steps are reasonable to prevent foreseeable outcomes, the taking of such steps would render any act or omission that resulted in riot damage to be classified as reasonably unforeseeable. The defence was therefore found to be rational.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Mogoeng CJ, then turned to considered whether the provision limited section 17 of the Constitution. Mogoeng J held that section 11(2) of the Regulation of Gatherings Act does limit section 17 of the Constitution as it requires conveners of gatherings to adhere to the requirements and can potentially increase the cost of organising a protest which could bar under-resourced organisations from being able to protest. The question was whether this limitation could be justified in terms of section 36(1) of the Constitution as a reasonable and justifiable limitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On conducting the limitation analysis in terms of section 36 of the Constitution, and looking at the importance of the right to assemble, the Court emphasised that the right to freedom of assembly is central to our constitutional democracy. It exists to give a voice to less powerful people in society and groups that do not wield political or economic power and other vulnerable persons. The right may be the only mechanism for such persons to express their concerns. Bearing in mind the significance of this right, the purpose of the limitation must be important enough to justify the limitation. The Court held that the purpose of the limitation, to protect individuals, especially those who themselves are under-resourced, who suffer damages caused by protests, is a crucial one. The Court reasoned that the public has no means to control protests whereas organisers are in a position to control and manage protests. Organizations have a choice between exercising the right to assemble or abandoning protests in order to prevent reasonably foreseeable damage. Conversely, victims of riot damage have no choice regarding what may happen to them or their property. Therefore, the Court held that the justification provided for by the law was viable and that the limitation on the right to freedom of assembly in <b>section 17 of the Constitution</b> was held to be reasonable and justifiable. The Court emphasized that the Regulation of Gatherings Act does not nullify the right to freedom of assembly, but imposes strict conditions on the right in order to prevent injury to persons or property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a concurring judgment, Jafta J held that the appeal should be dismissed, on the basis that the applicants had failed to prove that section 11(2) of the Regulations of Gatherings Act limited the right to freedom of assembly.

As a matter of logic what is bad for all children will be bad for one child in a particular case.

Kondile AJ, writing for the majority, started the equality analysis by firstly considering, whether the provision differentiated between categories of people and if there was such differentiation whether there was a legitimate rationale for such differentiation. During this first leg of the analysis, looking at the rational connection between the provision and its purpose, the Court emphasised that the private security industry was a special environment and at stake was the safety and security of the public at large. <b>Section 12 of the Constitution</b> provides everyone with the right to freedom and security of the person, which includes the right to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources. In a society rife with violent crime, the importance of protecting this right could not be exaggerated.\n\n</p><p>The majority judgment held that the regulatory scheme was carefully designed for the purpose of screening entrants to the private security industry rather than constituting a blanket ban on the registration of refugees as private security service providers. That is not to say that foreign nationals, including refugees, are inherently less trustworthy than South Africans. In a country where xenophobia has caused increased suffering, it was important to stress this and explain that it was not that the Authority did not trust refugees. The Security Act was designed to limit eligibility for registration to people whose trustworthiness could be objectively verified, and it was easier to verify the trustworthiness of citizens and permanent residents. The preamble to the Act acknowledges that the right to security of the person is fundamental to the well-being and to the social and economic development of every person. The Court therefore held that the differentiation between citizens and permanent residents on one hand and other foreigners in this instance, was rational and served a legitimate government purpose.</p> \n\n<p>On establishing differentiation, the majority judgment then considered whether the differentiation amounted to discrimination. The Court held that in this instance, the differentiation was on grounds analogous to those listed in section 9(3) of the Constitution, and therefore constituted discrimination. The analysis then turned to whether the discrimination was unfair. Various factors were considered by the Court on the question of fairness, such as the fact that  while refugees were fully entitled to work in South Africa, <b>section 22 of the Constitution</b> limited the right to choose a job to citizens only. The Court also considered that refugees could be registered as security service providers if the requirements of section 23(6) of the Security Act were met and that there was no complete exclusion of refugees from being registered. The majority found that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act did not unfairly discriminate against the applicants and was therefore constitutionally sound.</p>\n\n<p>In their dissenting judgment, Mokgoro J and O'Regan J held that section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act discriminated unfairly on the basis of refugee status. The joint dissenting judgment was not convinced that the purpose identified by the Minister to ensure that security service employees were trustworthy was really intended by the section. The dissenting judgment stated that the order it would have proposed was to require that refugees who could meet the other requirements of the Security Act should not be barred from registration as security service providers. Those refugees who could not meet those requirements should seek to establish that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for them to be registered as contemplated by section 23(6) of the Security Act.</p></div>", "snippet": "<p>The Constitutional Court had to determine whether the Authority\u2019s refusal to register the applicants as security service providers, on the basis that they are neither permanent residents nor citizens, was justified and whether section 23(1)(a) of the Security Act to the extent it excluded refugees from its scope constituted unfair discrimination in violation of section 9 of the Constitution.</p>", "topics": ["sec_12__Freedom_and_Security_of_the_Person"]}, {"id": "UniversityofStellenboschLegalAidClinicandOthersvMinisterofJusticeandCorrectionalServicesandOthersAssociationofDebtRecoveryAgentsNPCvUniversityofStellenboschLegalAidClinicandOthersMavavaTradingPtyLtdandOthersvUniversityofStellenboschLegalAidClinicandOthers", "date_updated": "2022-11-01T19:14:29.464Z", "title": "University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic and Others v Minister of Justice and Correctional Services and Others; Association of Debt Recovery Agents NPC v University of Stellenbosch Legal Aid Clinic and Others (CCT 127/15) [2016] ZACC 32", "href": "https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/judgment/zacc/2016/32/eng@2016-09-13", "facts_and_issues": "<p>The matter was referred to the Constitutional Court to confirm an order of constitutional invalidity made by the Western Cape Division of the High Court and an appeal was made against certain parts of the High Court\u2019s order.

This Proclamation governed the setting-up of special African townships by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in areas under the African Native Trust. This Proclamation was one of the tools with which the apartheid state disposed Africans from landholding and created barriers to Africans owning any land. Instead, Africans could only hold rights to the lands through an insecure tenure system of Deeds of Grant and Certificates of Occupancy and letting for residential purposes. The township manager had the authority to cancel this tenure at any point. Special deeds registries were created to register the deeds of grant under the legislation.</p>\n<p>When South Africa transitioned to democratic majority rule, the President, empowered by the Interim Constitution, passed Proclamation R9 of 1997 together with amendments to the Deeds Registry Act.
